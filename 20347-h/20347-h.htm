<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>

<h3>TROUBLE</h3>


<p>"Daddy is late; isn't he, Ruth?" asked Alice
DeVere of her sister, as she looked up from her
sewing.</p>

<p>"A little," answered the girl addressed, a tall,
fair maid, with deep blue eyes, in the depths of
which hidden meaning seemed to lie, awaiting
discovery by someone.</p>

<p>"A little!" exclaimed Alice, who was rather
plump, and whose dark brown hair and eyes were
in pleasing contrast to her sister's fairness.
"Why, he's more than an hour late, and he's seldom
that! He promised to be back from the
moving picture studio at four, and now it's after
five."</p>

<p>"I know, dear, but you remember he said he
had many things to talk over with Mr. Pertell,
and perhaps it has taken him longer than he anticipated.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span></p>

<p>"Besides you know there are some new plans
to be considered," went on Ruth. "Mr. Pertell
wants to get some different kinds of moving pictures&mdash;snow
scenes, I believe&mdash;and perhaps he has
kept daddy to talk about them. But why are you
so impatient? Are you afraid something has happened
to him?"</p>

<p>"Gracious, no! What put that idea into your
head?"</p>

<p>"Well, I didn't know whether you had noticed
it or not, but poor daddy hasn't been quite himself
since we came back from Oak Farm. I am
afraid something is bothering him&mdash;or worrying
him."</p>

<p>"Perhaps it is his voice, though it has seemed
better of late."</p>

<p>"I think not," said Ruth, slowly, as she bent
her head in a listening attitude, for a step was
coming along the hallway in the Fenmore Apartment,
where the DeVere girls and their father
had their rather limited quarters.</p>

<p>"That isn't he," said Ruth, with a little sigh of
disappointment. "I thought at first it was. No,
I don't mean that it was his voice, Alice. That
really seems better since he so suddenly became
hoarse, and had to take up moving picture work
instead of the legitimate drama he loves so much.
It is some other trouble, Alice."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span></p>

<p>"I hadn't noticed it, I confess. But I suppose
you'll say that I'm so flighty I never notice anything."</p>

<p>"I never called you flighty, dear. You are of
a lively disposition, that's all."</p>

<p>"And you are a wee bit too much the other
way, sister mine!" And then, to take any sting
out of the words, Alice rose from her chair with
a bound, crossed the room in a rush, and flung
her arms about her sister, embracing her heartily
and kissing her.</p>

<p>"Oh, Alice!" protested the other. "You are
crushing me!"</p>

<p>"I'm a regular bear, I suppose. Hark, is that
daddy?"</p>

<p>They both listened, but the footsteps died away
as before.</p>

<p>"Why are you so anxious?"</p>

<p>"I want some money, sister mine, and daddy
promised to bring my moving picture salary up
with him. I wanted to do a little shopping before
the stores close. But I'm afraid it's too late now,"
the girl added, ruefully. "Daddy said he'd be
here in plenty of time, and he never <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'dissappointed'">disappointed</ins>
me before."</p>

<p>"Oh, if that's all you're worrying about, I'll
lend you some money."</p>

<p>"Will you, really? Then I'll get ready and go.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
There's that little French shop just around the
corner. They keep open after the others. Madame
Morey is so thrifty, and there was the
sweetest shirt waist in the window the other day.
I hope it isn't gone! I'll get ready at once. You
be getting out the money, Ruth, dear. Is there
anything I can get for you? It's awfully kind of
you. Shall I bring back anything for supper?"</p>

<p>"Gracious, what a rattlebox you're getting to
be, Alice," spoke Ruth, soberly, as she laid aside
her sewing and went to the bureau for her pocketbook.</p>

<p>"That's half of life!" laughed the younger
girl. "Quick, Ruth, I want to get out and get
back, and be here when daddy comes. I want to
hear all about the new plans for taking moving
picture plays. Is that the money? Thanks! I'm
off!" and the girl fairly rushed down the hall of
the apartment. Ruth heard her call a greeting to
Mrs. Dalwood, who lived across the corridor&mdash;a
cheery greeting, in her fresh, joyous voice.</p>

<p>"Dear little sister!" murmured Ruth, as she
sat with folded hands, looking off into space and
meditating. "She enjoys life!"</p>

<p>And certainly Alice DeVere did. Not that
Ruth did not also; but it was in a different way.
Alice was of a more lively disposition, and her
father said she reminded him every day more and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
more of her dead mother. Ruth had an element
of romanticism in her character, which perhaps
accounted for her dreaminess at times. In the
work of acting and posing for moving pictures,
which was what the two girls, and their father, a
veteran actor, were engaged in, Ruth always
played the romantic parts, while nothing so rejoiced
Alice as to have a hoydenish part to enact.</p>

<p>Alice hastened along the streets, now covered
with a film of newly fallen snow. It was sifting
down from a leaden sky, and the clouds had added
to the darkness which was already coming that
November evening.</p>

<p>"Oh, it's good to be alive, such weather as
this!" Alice exulted as she hastened along, the
crisp air and the exercise bringing to her cheeks
a deeper bloom. Her eyes shone, and there was
so much of life and youth and vitality in her
that, as she hastened along through the falling
snow, which dusted itself on her furs, more than
one passerby turned to look at her in admiration.
She was a "moving picture" in herself.</p>

<p>She lingered long in the quaint little French
shop, there were so many bargains in the way of
lingerie. Alice looked at many longingly, and
turned some over more longingly, but she thought
of her purse, and knew it would not stand the
strain to which she contemplated putting it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'll just have to wait about the others, Madame,"
she said, with a sigh. "I've really bought
more now than I intended."</p>

<p>"I hope zat Mademoiselle will come often!"
laughed the French woman.</p>

<p>Back through the streets, now covered with
snow, hastened Alice, tripping lightly, and now
and then, when she thought no one was watching
her, she took a little run and slide, as in the days
of her childhood. Not that she was much more
than a child still, being only a little over fifteen.
Ruth was two years her senior, but Ruth considered
herself quite "grown up."</p>

<p>"I wonder if daddy has come back yet?" Alice
mused, as she hastened on to the apartment.
"That looks like Russ Dalwood ahead of me,"
she went on, referring to the son of the neighbor
across the hall. Russ "filmed," or made the
moving pictures for the company by whom Mr.
DeVere and his daughters were engaged. "Yes,
it is Russ!" the girl exclaimed. "He has probably
come right from the studio, and he'll know
about daddy. Russ! Russ!" she called, as she
came nearer to the young man.</p>

<p>He turned, and a welcoming smile lighted his
face.</p>

<p>"Oh, hello, Alice!" he greeted, genially.
"Where's Ruth?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<p>"Just for that I shan't tell you! Don't you
want to walk with <i>me?</i>" she asked, archly.
"Why must you always ask for Ruth when I
meet you alone?"</p>

<p>"I didn't! I mean&mdash;I&mdash;er&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, don't try to make it any worse!" she
laughed at his discomfiture. "Let it go at that!
Did you just come from the studio?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and we had a hard day of it. I forget
how many thousand feet of film I reeled off."</p>

<p>"Was my father there?"</p>

<p>"Yes, he was with Mr. Pertell when I came
out."</p>

<p>"I wonder what makes him so late?"</p>

<p>"Oh, there's a rush of work on. But I think
he'll be along soon, for I heard Mr. Pertell say
he wouldn't keep him five minutes."</p>

<p>"That's good. Oh, dear! Isn't it slippery!"
she cried, as she barely saved herself from falling.</p>

<p>"Take my arm," invited Russ.</p>

<p>"Thanks, I will. I came out in a hurry to do
a little shopping. Ruth is at home. There, I
told you after all. I'm of a forgiving spirit,
you see."</p>

<p>"I see," he laughed.</p>

<p>They stepped along lightly together, laughing
and talking, for Russ was almost like a brother<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
to the DeVere girls, though the two families had
only known each other since both had come to
the Fenmore Apartment, about a year before.</p>

<p>"Did they film any big plays to-day?" asked
Alice. "I know Mr. Pertell said he wouldn't
need Ruth and myself, so of course they didn't
do anything really good. Not at all conceited;
am I?" she asked, with a rippling laugh.</p>

<p>"Well, you're right this time&mdash;there wasn't
much of importance doing," Russ replied. "Miss
Pennington and Miss Dixon had some pretty
good parts, but the stuff was mostly comic to-day."</p>

<p>"That suited Mr. Switzer, then. I think he is
the nicest German comedian I ever knew, and I
met quite a number when father was appearing
in real plays."</p>

<p>"Yes, Switzer is a good sort. But you should
have seen Mr. Sneed to-day!"</p>

<p>"Found fault with everything; eh?"</p>

<p>"I should say so, and then some, as the boys
say. He said something was sure to happen
before the day was over, and it did&mdash;a stone wall
fell on him."</p>

<p>"Really?"</p>

<p>"Really, but not real stone. It was one of
Pop Snooks's scenic creations. One of the pieces
of wood hit Mr. Sneed on the head, so something<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
happened. And what a fuss he made! He's the
real grouch of the company, all right. Well, here
we are!" and the young man guided his companion
into the hallway of the Fenmore.</p>

<p>"See you again!" called Alice, as she went
into her door and Russ into his.</p>

<p>"Is that you, Alice?" called Ruth, from an
inner room.</p>

<p>"Yes, dear. Has daddy come home?"</p>

<p>"Not yet. I wonder if we'd better telephone?"</p>

<p>"No, I just met Russ, and he said daddy would
be right along. He's planning something with
Mr. Pertell."</p>

<p>The table was nearly prepared when a step was
heard in the hall.</p>

<p>"There he is now!" cried Alice, as she flew
to open the door before her father could get out
his key. But as he entered, and Alice reached up
to kiss him, she cried out in amazement at the
look on his face.</p>

<p>"Why, Daddy! Has anything happened?"
she asked.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said in his hoarse voice&mdash;a hoarseness
caused by a throat affection. "Yes, something
has happened, or is going to. I'm in serious
trouble!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>

<h3>AN UNPLEASANT VISITOR</h3>


<p>Ruth overheard the question asked by Alice,
and her father's answer. She came in swiftly,
and put her arms about him, as her sister had
done.</p>

<p>"Oh, Daddy dear, what is it?" she asked,
anxiously.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I'll tell you&mdash;presently," he replied, chokingly.
"I am a little out of breath. I am getting
too&mdash;too stout. And my throat has bothered
me a good deal of late. Would you mind
getting me that throat spray and medicine Dr.
Rathby left? That always helps me."</p>

<p>"I'll get it," offered Alice, quickly, as her
father sank into a chair, and while she searched
in the medicine closet for it, there was a dull
ache in her heart. More trouble! And there
had been so much of it of late. The sun had
seemed to break through the clouds, and now it
had gone behind again.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>And while the girls are thus preparing to minister
to their father, I will tell my new readers
something of the previous books of this series,
and a little about the main characters.</p>

<p>In the initial volume, entitled "The Moving
Picture Girls; Or, First Appearances in Photo
Dramas," I related how Mr. Hosmer DeVere, a
talented actor, suddenly lost his voice, by the return
of an old throat affection. He had just
been "cast" for an important part in a new
play, but had to give it up, as he could not speak
distinctly enough to be heard across the footlights.</p>

<p>The DeVere family fortunes were at low ebb,
and money was much needed. By accident Russ
Dalwood, a moving picture operator, suggested
to one of the girls that their father might act for
a moving picture film company, as he would not
have to use his voice in such employment.</p>

<p>How Mr. DeVere took the engagement, and
how Ruth and Alice followed him, as well as
their part in helping Russ to save a valuable
camera patent&mdash;all this you will find set down in
the first book.</p>

<p>In the second volume, entitled "The Moving
Picture Girls at Oak Farm; Or, Queer Happenings
While Taking Rural Plays," the scene was
shifted to the country. There you may read of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
many strange occurrences, as well as funny ones&mdash;how
Alice fell into the water&mdash;but there! I
must save my space in this book for the happenings
of it. I might add that, incidentally, the
girls helped to solve a strange mystery concerning
Oak Farm, and solved it in a way that made
glad the hearts of Mr. and Mrs. Felix Apgar,
the parents of Sandy, and of the heart of Sandy
himself.</p>

<p>Mr. Frank Pertell was the manager of the
Comet Film Company, with whom Mr. DeVere
and his daughters had an engagement, and the
entire company, including the DeVeres, spent a
whole summer at Oak Farm, in New Jersey,
making rural plays.</p>

<p>The company had just returned to New York
City, to finish some dramas there, and Mr. Pertell
was working on new plans, which were not,
as yet, fully developed.</p>

<p>The Comet Film Company included a number
of people, and you will meet some of them from
time to time as this story advances. You have already
heard of a few members. In addition there
was Wellington Bunn, a former Shakespearean
actor, who could never seem to get away from an
ambition to do Hamlet. Pepper Sneed was the
"grouch" of the company, always finding fault,
or worrying lest something happen. Paul Ardite<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
was the "leading juvenile," the father of the
moving picture girls being the leading man. The
girls themselves, though comparatively new to the
business, had made wonderful strides, for they
had the advantage of private "coaching" at home
from Mr. DeVere.</p>

<p>Miss Pearl Pennington and Miss Laura Dixon
were former vaudeville actresses, who had gone
into the "movies," and between them and the
DeVeres there was not the best of feeling; caused
by the jealousy of the former.</p>

<p>Carl Switzer, a German with a marked accent,
generally did "comics." Then there was Mrs.
Maguire, who did "old woman" parts. She had
two grandchildren, Tommy and Nellie, who frequently
played minor <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'roles'">r&ocirc;les</ins>.</p>

<p>"Do you feel any better, Daddy?" asked Ruth,
as she took from her father's hand the atomizer
he had been using on his throat.</p>

<p>"Yes, the pain is much less. Dr. Rathby's
medicine is a wonderful help."</p>

<p>"Do you feel like&mdash;talking?" inquired Alice
gently, for she saw that the worried look had not
<ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'felt'">left</ins> her father's face.</p>

<p>"Yes," he answered, with a smile, "but I do
not want to burden you girls with all of my
troubles."</p>

<p>"Why shouldn't you?" asked Ruth, quickly.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
"Who would you share your troubles with, if not
with us? We must help each other!"</p>

<p>"Yes, I suppose so," returned Mr. DeVere, in
a low voice. "And yet, after all, I suppose this
is not such a terrible trouble. It will not kill any
of us. But it will make a hard pull for me if I
cannot prove my contention."</p>

<p>"What is that?" asked Alice. "Is there some
trouble with the film company? You haven't lost
your engagement; have you, Daddy?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, it isn't that," he answered. "I'll
tell you. Just a little more of that spray, please,
Alice. I will then be better able to talk."</p>

<p>In a few moments he resumed:</p>

<p>"Did you ever hear me speak of a Dan
Merley?"</p>

<p>"You mean that man who came to see you
when we lived in the other apartment&mdash;the nicer
one?" asked Ruth, for the Fenmore was not one
of the high-class residences of New York. The
DeVeres had not been able to afford a better
home in the time of their poverty. And when
better days came they had still remained, as they
liked their neighbors, the Dalwoods. Then, too,
they had been away all summer at Oak Farm.</p>

<p>"Yes, that was the man," replied Mr. DeVere.
"Well, in my hard luck days I borrowed five
hundred dollars from him to meet some pressing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
needs. I gave him my note for it. By hard
work, later, I was able to scrape the five hundred
dollars together, and I paid him back.</p>

<p>"Unfortunately Dan Merley was a bit under
the influence of drink when I gave him the cash,
and he could not find my promissory note to
return to me.</p>

<p>"He promised to send it around to me the
next day, and, very foolishly, as I see it now, I
let him keep the money, not even getting a receipt
for it. I am not a business man&mdash;never
was one. I trusted Dan Merley, and I should
not have done so."</p>

<p>"Why?" asked Ruth.</p>

<p>"Because he came to me to-day, for the first
time in several months, and demanded his five
hundred dollars. I told him I had paid it, and
tried to recall to him the circumstances. But, as
I said, he was slightly intoxicated when I gave
him the bills, and his mind was not clear. He
declares positively that I never paid him, and
he says he will make trouble for me if I do
not hand him over the money in a short
time."</p>

<p>"But you did give it to him, Daddy!" exclaimed
Alice.</p>

<p>"Of course I did; but I have no proof."</p>

<p>"Did you pay him by check?" asked Ruth,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
who was quite a business woman, and keeper
of the house.</p>

<p>"Unfortunately I was not prosperous enough
in those days to have a bank account," answered
Mr. DeVere. "A check would be a receipt; but
I haven't that. In fact, I haven't a particle of
evidence to show that I paid the money. And
Dan Merley has my note. He could sue me on
it, and any court would give him a judgment
against me, so he could collect."</p>

<p>"But that would be paying him twice!" exclaimed
Alice.</p>

<p>"I know it, and that is the injustice of it. It
would be out of the question for me to raise
five hundred dollars now. My throat treatment
has been expensive, and though we are making
good money at the moving picture business, I
have not enough to pay this debt twice."</p>

<p>"He is a wicked man!" burst out Alice.</p>

<p>"My dear!" Ruth gently reproved.</p>

<p>"I don't care! He is, to make daddy pay
twice!"</p>

<p>"Yes, it is hard lines," sighed the veteran
actor. "I have begged and pleaded with Merley,
imploring him to try and remember that I
paid him, but he is positive that I did not do
so."</p>

<p>"Do you suppose he really thinks so&mdash;that he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
is honest in his belief that you never paid him?"
asked Ruth.</p>

<p>"Well, it is a hard thing to say against a
man, when I have no proof," replied Mr. DeVere,
"but I believe, in his heart, Dan Merley
knows I paid him. I think he is just trying to
make me pay him over again to cheat me."</p>

<p>"Oh, how can he be so cruel?" cried Alice.</p>

<p>"He is a hard man to deal with," went on
her father. "A very hard man. This has been
bothering me all day. I simply cannot pay that
five hundred dollars; and yet, if I don't&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Can they lock you up, Daddy?" Alice questioned,
fearfully.</p>

<p>"Oh, no, dear, not that. But he can make it
very unpleasant for me. He can force me to go
to court, and that would take me away from the
film studio. I might even lose my engagement
there if I had to spend too much time over a
lawsuit.</p>

<p>"But, worst of all, my reputation will suffer.
I have always been honest, and I have paid every
debt I owed, though sometimes it took a little
while to do it. Now if this comes to smirch my
character, I don't know what I shall do."</p>

<p>"Poor Daddy!" said Ruth, softly, as she
smoothed his rumpled hair.</p>

<p>"There, girls, don't let me bother you," he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
said, as gaily as he could. "Perhaps there may
come a way out."</p>

<p>"Why don't you ask the advice of Mr. Pertell?"
suggested Ruth.</p>

<p>"I believe I will," agreed her father. "He is
a good business man. I wish I was. If I had
been I would have insisted on getting either a
receipt from Merley, or my note back. But I
trusted him. I thought he was a friend of mine."</p>

<p>"Well, let's have supper," suggested Alice.
"Matters may look brighter then."</p>

<p>"And I'll go see Mr. Pertell this evening,"
promised Mr. DeVere. "He may be able to advise
and help me."</p>

<p>The meal was not a very jolly one at first, but
gradually the feeling of gloom passed as the supper
progressed. Mr. DeVere told of what had
happened that day at the film studio where the
moving pictures were made.</p>

<p>"Now I think I'll go see Mr. Pertell," the actor
announced, as he rose from the table. "He said
he would be in his office late to-night, as he is
working on some new plans."</p>

<p>"What are they, Daddy?" asked Alice. "Are
we to go off to some farm again?"</p>

<p>"Not this time. I believe there are to be some
winter scenes taken, though just where we will go
for them has not been announced. Well, I'm<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
off," and, kissing the girls good-bye, Mr. DeVere
went out.</p>

<p>Ruth and Alice, in his absence, discussed the
new source of trouble that had come to them.
They had been so happy all summer, that the blow
fell doubly heavy.</p>

<p>"Isn't it just horrid!" exclaimed Ruth.</p>

<p>"Too mean for anything!" agreed Alice. "I
wish I had that Dan Merley here. I&mdash;I'd&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But Alice did not finish. Ruth had looked at
her, to stop her rather impulsive sister from the
use of too violent an expression. But there was
no need of this. An interruption came in the
form of a knock at the door.</p>

<p>"Who is it?" asked Ruth, and there came a
little note of fear into her voice, for she was
timid, and she realized at once that it was not one
of their kind neighbors from across the hall.
Russ, his mother, and his brother Billy always
rapped in a characteristic manner.</p>

<p>"It's me&mdash;Dan Merley, and I want to see the
old man!" was the answer. The girls drew together
in fright, for they recognized by the thickness
of the voice that the owner was not altogether
himself.</p>

<p>"Oh!" gasped Alice, and then the door was
pushed open, for the catch had been left off, and
a man came unsteadily into the room.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>

<h3>RUSS TO THE RESCUE</h3>


<p>"Where's the boss?" asked the man, as he
leaned heavily against the table. "I want to see
the boss."</p>

<p>"Do you&mdash;do you mean my&mdash;my father?"
faltered Ruth, as she stepped protectingly in front
of Alice.</p>

<p>"That's jest who I mean, young lady," and the
new-comer leered at her. "Is he in? If he isn't
I won't mind an awful lot. I'll wait for him.
This is a nice place," and, without being invited
he slouched into a chair.</p>

<p>"My&mdash;my father is&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He'll be back in just a little while!" interrupted
Alice, briskly. "Did he tell you to come
here?"</p>

<p>"Nope! I told myself!" replied the man. "I'm
glad I did, too. This is nice place and you're
nice girls, too. Sisters, I take it?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>"You need not discuss us!" exclaimed Ruth
with dignity. "If you will leave word what your
business with my father is I will have him call on
you."</p>

<p>"What, leave? Me leave? Nothin' doin', sister.
I'm too comfortable here," and he leaned
back in the chair and laughed foolishly.</p>

<p>"What&mdash;what did you want to see Mr. DeVere
about?" inquired Ruth, though she could well
guess.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you what it's about," said Dan Merley,
confidentially. "It's about money. I want
five hundred dollars from your father, and I want
it quick&mdash;with interest, too. Don't forget that."</p>

<p>"My father paid you that money!" Ruth declared,
with boldness.</p>

<p>"He did not!" denied the unpleasant visitor.
"He owes it to me yet, and I want it. And,
what's more I'm going to have it!"</p>

<p>"That is unfair&mdash;unjust!" said Ruth, and
there was a trace of tears in her voice. "My
father paid you the money, and you promised to
give him back the note&mdash;the paper that showed
you had loaned it to him. But you never did."</p>

<p>"How do you know all this?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Because my father was just telling us about
it&mdash;a little while ago. He said you had&mdash;forgotten."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, I know! He said I'd been drinking too
much; didn't he?"</p>

<p>Ruth and Alice drew further back, offended by
his coarse language.</p>

<p>"He&mdash;he said you were not&mdash;quite yourself,"
spoke Alice gently.</p>

<p>"Oh ho! Another one! So there's two of you
here!" laughed the man. "Well, this certainly is
a nice place. I guess I'll stay until the boss comes
back. That is, unless you have the five hundred
dollars here, and <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'went'">want</ins> to pay me," he added,
with a sickly grin.</p>

<p>"You have been paid once," Ruth insisted.</p>

<p>"I have not&mdash;I never was paid!" Dan Merley
cried. "I want my money and I'm going to have
it! Do you hear? I'm going to have it, and
have it soon! You tell your father that from
me!" and he banged his fist on the table.</p>

<p>Ruth and Alice looked at each other. The same
thought was in both their minds, and it shone
from their eyes. They must leave at once&mdash;the
door was slightly open.</p>

<p>"No more monkey business!" cried the unwelcome
caller. "I lent your father that money
and he never paid me back. He may say he did;
but he can't prove it. I hold his note, and if he
doesn't pay me I'll&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What will you do?" interrupted a new voice,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
and with relief Ruth and Alice looked up, to see
Russ Dalwood entering the room.</p>

<p>"Excuse me," he said to the girls, "I knocked,
but you did not seem to hear. Possibly there was
too much noise," and he looked at the man significantly.
"Is there any trouble here?" the young
moving picture operator asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, Russ, make him&mdash;make him go!" begged
Alice, half sobbing. "He wants to see my father&mdash;it's
some sort of unjust money claim&mdash;and he
wants to enforce it. Father has gone out&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And that's just where this person is going!"
announced Russ, advancing toward the man.</p>

<p>"What's that?" demanded Merley in an ugly
tone.</p>

<p>"I said you were going out. It's your cue to
move!"</p>

<p>"I don't move until I get my five hundred dollars,"
answered the visitor. "I've waited for it
long enough."</p>

<p>"My father paid you!" protested Ruth.</p>

<p>"I say he did not!" and again the man banged
the table with his fist.</p>

<p>"Well, whether he did or not is a question for
you and Mr. DeVere to settle," said Russ, in
firm tones. "You will kindly leave these young
ladies alone."</p>

<p>"I will; eh? Who says so?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>"I do!"</p>

<p>"And who are you?"</p>

<p>"A friend. I must ask you to leave."</p>

<p>"Not until I get my five hundred dollars!"</p>

<p>"Look here!" exclaimed Russ, and, though he
spoke in low tones, there was that in his voice
which made it very determined. "You may have
a valid claim against Mr. DeVere, or you may
not. I will not go into that. But he is not at
home, and you will have to come again.
You have no right in here. I must ask you to
leave."</p>

<p>"Huh! You haven't any right here either.
You can't give <i>me</i> orders."</p>

<p>"They are not my orders. This is a request
from the young ladies themselves, and I am
merely seeing that it is carried out. You don't
want him here; do you?" he asked, of the two
girls.</p>

<p>"Oh, no! Please go!" begged Ruth.</p>

<p>"I want my money!" cried the man.</p>

<p>"Look here!" exclaimed Russ, taking hold of
Merley's shoulder. "You will either leave
quietly, or I'll summon a policeman and have you
arrested. Even if you have a claim against Mr.
DeVere, and I don't believe you have, that gives
you no right to trespass here. Take your claim
to court!"</p>

<p>"I tell you I want my money now!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, you'll not get it. You have your remedy
at law. Now leave at once, do you hear?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I hear all right, and you'll hear from me
later. I will go to law, and I'll have my five hundred
dollars. I'll bring suit against Mr. DeVere,
and then he'll wish he'd paid me, for he'll have to
settle my claim and costs besides. Oh, I'll sue all
right!"</p>

<p>"I don't care what you do, as long as you get
out of here!" cried Russ, sharply, for he saw
that the strain was telling on Ruth and Alice.
"Leave at once!"</p>

<p>"Suppose I don't go?"</p>

<p>"Then I'll put you out!"</p>

<p>Russ looked very brave as he said this. Ruth
glanced at him, and thought he had never appeared
to better advantage. And between Russ
and Ruth there was&mdash;but there, I am getting
ahead of my story.</p>

<p>"Are you going?" asked the young moving
picture operator, again.</p>

<p>"Well, rather than have a row, I will. But I
warn you I'll sue DeVere and I'll get my money,
too. It's all nonsense for him to say he paid me.
Where's his proof? I ask you that. Where's
his proof?"</p>

<p>"Never mind about that," returned Russ,
calmly. "It's your move, as I said before. And
you can give a good imitation of a moving pic<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>ture
film showing a man getting out of a room."</p>

<p>With no good grace the man arose clumsily
from his chair, and with leers at Ruth and Alice,
who were clinging to each other on the far side
of the room, the visitor started for the door.</p>

<p>"I'll see you again!" he called, coarsely.
"Then maybe the laugh will be on my side. I'm
going to have my money, I tell you!"</p>

<p>Russ kept after the man, and walked behind
him to the door. There Dan Merley paused to
exclaim, in loud tones:</p>

<p>"You wait&mdash;I'll get my money out of DeVere&mdash;you'll
see!"</p>

<p>Then he stumbled on down the hallway, and
Russ quickly closed and locked the door.</p>

<p>"Oh, Russ!" exclaimed Ruth. Then she sank
into a chair, and bent forward with her head pillowed
in her arms on the table.</p>

<p>"There, there," said the young man gently, as
he put his hand on her head. "It's all right&mdash;he's
gone. Don't be afraid."</p>

<p>"Oh, but what a dreadful man!" cried Alice.
"I could&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't, dear," begged her sister gently, as she
raised her head. There were tears in her eyes.
Russ gently slipped his hand over her little rosy
palm.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<h3>A FUNNY FILM</h3>


<p>For a moment Ruth remained thus, while,
Alice, with flashing eyes, stood looking at the
door leading into the hall, as if anticipating the
return of that unpleasant visitor. Then Ruth
lifted her head, and with a rosy blush, and a shy
look at Russ, disengaged her hand.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I feel better now," she said.</p>

<p>"That's good," and he smiled. "I don't believe
that fellow will come back. I'll stay here.
Is your father out?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and all on account of that horrid man,"
answered Alice. "Oh, it was so good of you to
come in Russ!"</p>

<p>"I happened to be coming here anyhow," he
answered. "When I saw the door open, and
heard what was said, which I could not help doing,
I did not stand on ceremony."</p>

<p>"It was awfully good of you," murmured
Ruth, who now seemed quite herself again. "I
suppose you heard what that man said?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>"Not all," he made reply. "It was something
about money though, I gathered. He was demanding
it."</p>

<p>"Yes, and after father has already paid it,"
put in Alice. "That's where daddy has gone
now&mdash;to consult Mr. Pertell as to the best course
of action."</p>

<p>Between them, Ruth and Alice told about Dan
Merley's claim, and the injustice of it. Russ was
duly sympathetic.</p>

<p>"If I were your father I would pay no attention
to his demand," the young moving picture
operator said.</p>

<p>"But suppose he sues, as he threatened?"
asked Ruth.</p>

<p>"Let him, and fight the case in court when it
comes up. Merley may be only 'bluffing', to
use a common expression."</p>

<p>"But it annoys daddy almost as much as if
the case were real, you see," said Ruth. "Won't
you sit down, Russ? Excuse our impoliteness,
but really we've been quite upset."</p>

<p>"Thanks," he laughed as he took a chair.
"You need cheering up. You come to the studio
to-morrow and forget your troubles in a good
laugh."</p>

<p>"Why?" asked Alice. "Ruth and I are not
down for any parts to-morrow."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, but Mr. Switzer is going to do some
comic stunts, and Mr. Bunn and Mr. Sneed are
in them with him. There are to be some trick
films, I believe."</p>

<p>"Then we'll go," decided Alice. "I think a
laugh would do me good."</p>

<p>Gradually the little fright wore off, and when
Mr. DeVere returned shortly afterward the girls
were themselves again, under the happy influence
of Russ.</p>

<p>"What luck, Daddy?" asked Alice, as her
father came in. He shook his head, as she
added: "Russ knows all about it," for she gathered
that he might not like to speak before the
young man. "What did Mr. Pertell say?"</p>

<p>"He advised me to wait until Merley made
the next move, and then come and see him again.
He said he would then send me to the attorney
for the film company, who would handle my case
without charge."</p>

<p>"How good of him!" cried Ruth, impulsively.</p>

<p>"Mr. Pertell gave daddy the same advice Russ
gave us," added Alice. "Oh, it was so good to
have him here when that dreadful man came in,"
she went on.</p>

<p>"What man?" asked Mr. DeVere, in surprise.
"Was someone in here while I was gone&mdash;those
camera scoundrels, Russ?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, it was Dan Merley himself!" exclaimed
Ruth, "and he was so horrid, Daddy!" There
was a hint of tears in her voice.</p>

<p>"The impertinent scoundrel!" exclaimed Mr.
DeVere, in the manner that had won him such
success on the stage. "I shall go to the police
and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, don't Daddy dear," begged Ruth laying
a detaining hand on his arm, as he turned to the
door. "That would only make it more unpleasant
for us. We would have to go to court and
testify, if you had him arrested. And, besides,
I don't know on what charge you could cause his
arrest. He really did nothing to us, except to
hurt our feelings and scare us. But I fancy Russ
scared him in turn. Don't go to the police,
Daddy."</p>

<p>"All right," he agreed. "But tell me all about
it."</p>

<p>They did so, by turns, and Mr. DeVere's anger
waxed hot against Merley as he listened. But
he realized that it was best to take no rash step,
much as he desired to. So he finally calmed
down.</p>

<p>"If I could only prove that I had paid that
money," he murmured, "all would be well. I
must make it a point, after this, to be more business-like.
It is like locking the stable door after<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
the automobile is gone, though, in this case," he
added, with a whimsical smile.</p>

<p>Russ remained a little longer, and then took
his leave. Ruth saw to it, even getting up out of
bed to do it, that the chain was on the hall door.
For she was in nervous doubt as to whether or
not she had taken that precaution. But she
found the portal secure.</p>

<p>"That man might come back in the night,"
she thought. But she did not confide her fear to
Alice.</p>

<p>Morning revealed a new and wonderful scene.
For in the night there had been a heavy storm,
and the ground of Central Park was white with
snow. A little rain had fallen, and then had frozen,
and the trees were encased in ice. Then as
the sun shone brightly, it flashed as on millions
of diamonds, dazzling and glittering. Winter
had come early, and with more severity than
usual in the vicinity of New York.</p>

<p>"Oh, how lovely!" cried Alice, as she looked
out. "I must have a slide, if I can find a place!
Ruth, I'm going to wash your face!"</p>

<p>"Don't you dare!"</p>

<p>But Alice raised the window, and from the sill
took a <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'handfull'">handful</ins> of snow. She rushed over to
her sister with it.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p><p>"Stop it! Stop it! Don't you dare!"
screamed Ruth. Then she squealed as she felt
the cold snow on her cheeks.</p>

<p>"What's the matter with you girls in there?"
called Mr. DeVere from his apartment. "You
seem merry enough."</p>

<p>"We are," answered Alice. "I've washed
Ruth's face, and I'm going to wash yours in a
minute."</p>

<p>"Just as you like," he laughed. And then he
sighed, for he recalled a time when his girlish
wife had once challenged him the same way,
when they were on their honeymoon. For Mrs.
DeVere had been vivacious like Alice, and the
younger daughter was a constant reminder to her
father of his dead wife&mdash;a happy and yet a sad
reminder.</p>

<p>Alice came rushing in with more snow, and
there was a merry little scene before breakfast.
Then Mr. DeVere hurried to the film studio, for
he was to take part in several dramas that day.</p>

<p>"I know I'll be late," he said, "for the travel
will be slow this morning, on account of the
snow. And I have to go part way by surface
car, as I have an errand on the way down town."</p>

<p>"We're coming down, also," Ruth informed
him.</p>

<p>"Why, you're not in anything to-day," he
remarked, pausing in the act of putting on his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
overcoat. "You're not cast for anything until
'The Price of Honor,' to-morrow."</p>

<p>"But we're going down, just the same," Alice
laughed. "We want to see some of the funny
films."</p>

<p>"Come ahead then," invited Mr. DeVere.
"Better use the subway all you can. Even the
elevated will have trouble with all this sleet.
Good-bye," and he kissed them as he hurried out.</p>

<p>The girls made short shrift of the housework,
and then left for the place where the moving
pictures were made.</p>

<p>As I have described in the first book of this
series how moving pictures are taken, I will not
repeat it here, except to say that in a special camera,
made for the purpose, there is a long narrow
strip of celluloid film, of the same nature as in
the ordinary camera. The pictures are taken on
this strip, at the rate of sixteen a second. Later
this film is developed, and from that "negative"
a "positive" is made. This "positive" is then
run through a specially made projecting lantern
which magnifies the pictures for the screen.</p>

<p>As Alice and Ruth got out at the floor where
most of the scenes were made they heard
laughter.</p>

<p>"Something's going on," remarked the
younger girl.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>"And it doesn't sound like Mr. Sneed, our
cheerful 'grouch,' either," answered Ruth.</p>

<p>As they went in they saw Carl Switzer, the
German comedian, climbing a high step-ladder
with a pail of paste in one hand, and a roll of
wall paper in the other. He was in a scene representing
a room, which he was to decorate.</p>

<p>"Is diss der right vay to do it?" Mr. Switzer
asked, as he paused half way up the ladder, and
looked at Mr. Pertell.</p>

<p>"That's it. Now you've got the idea," replied
the manager. "Begin over again, and Russ, I
guess you can begin to run the film now," for the
young moving picture operator was in readiness
with his camera.</p>

<p>"You must tremble, and shake the ladder,"
advised the manager, who was also, in this case,
the stage director. "You want to register fear,
you see, because you are an amateur paper
hanger."</p>

<p>"Yah. Dot's right. I know so leedle about
der papering business alretty yet dot I could
write a big book on vot I don't know," confessed
Mr. Switzer.</p>

<p>"All ready now&mdash;tremble and shake!" ordered
the manager.</p>

<p>The comic film that was being made was a reproduction
of a scene often played in vaudeville<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
theaters, where an amateur paper hanger gets
into all sorts of ludicrous mishaps with a bucket
of paste, rolls of paper and the step ladder. It
was not very new, but had not been done for moving
pictures before.</p>

<p>"Here I goes!" called Mr. Switzer. "I am
shaking!"</p>

<p>"Good!" encouraged Mr. Pertell. "Now,
Mr. Bunn, you come in, as the owner of the house,
to see if the paper hanger is doing his work properly.
You find he is not, for he is going to put
the wrong sort of paper on the ceiling. Then you
try to show him yourself."</p>

<p>"Do I wear my tall hat?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, of course, and I think Mr. Switzer,
you had better let&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But the directions were never completed, for at
that moment, in the excess of his zeal, Mr.
Switzer shook the step ladder to such good effect
that it toppled over and with him on it.</p>

<p>Down he came on top of Wellington Bunn, in
all his dignity and the glory of the tall hat, and
paste flew all over, liberally spattering both actors.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>

<h3>A QUEER ACCIDENT</h3>


<p>"Get that Russ! Every motion of it!" cried
the manager. "That will make it better than
when we rehearsed it. Spatter that paste all over
Mr. Bunn while you're at it, Mr. Switzer."</p>

<p>"Stop! Stop, I say! I protest. I will not
have it!"</p>

<p>"Vell, you goin' to git it, all right!" cried the
German, and with the brush he liberally daubed
the Shakespearean actor with the white and sticky
stuff. All the other players were laughing at the
ridiculous scene.</p>

<p>"More paste!" ordered Mr. Pertell. "More
paste there, Mr. Switzer. Don't be afraid of it,
Mr. Bunn! It's clean!"</p>

<p>"Oh, this is awful&mdash;this is terrible!" groaned
the tragic actor. "My hat is ruined."</p>

<p>And such did seem to be the case, for the shining
silk tile was filled with paste, the outside also
being well covered.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Bunn tried to get away from the slapping
brush of Mr. Switzer, but the German was not to
be outwitted. The two had fallen to the floor
under the impact of the comic player, and were
now tangled up in the ladder.</p>

<p>"That's good! That's good!" laughed Mr.
Pertell. "Get all of that, Russ! Every bit!"</p>

<p>"I'm getting it!" cried the operator, as he continued
to grind away at the crank of the moving
picture camera.</p>

<p>Again Mr. Bunn tried to get up and away, but
the ladder, through which his legs had slipped,
hampered him. Then a roll of the paper got under
the feet of both players. It unreeled, and some
paste got on it. The next instant part of it was
plastered over Mr. Switzer's face, and, being unable
to see, he pawed about <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'wildy'">wildly</ins>, spattering more
paste all over, much of it getting on Mr. Bunn.</p>

<p>"Better than ever. Use some more of that
paper!" ordered the manager. "Paste some on
Mr. Switzer, if you can, Mr. Bunn."</p>

<p>"Oh, I can all right!" cried the older actor.
"Here is where I have my revenge!"</p>

<p>He scooped up a hand full of paste, spread it on
a piece of paper, and clapped it over the face of
the German, for that player had removed the first
piece that was stuck on. And thus they capered
about in the scenic room, making a chaos of it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>Russ took all the pictures for the future amusement
of thousands who attended the darkened
theaters.</p>

<p>Of course it was horseplay, pure and simple,
and yet audiences go into paroxysms of mirth over
much the same things. The love of slap-stick
comedy has not all died out, and the managers
realize this.</p>

<p>"I don't know when I've laughed so much,"
confessed Alice, holding her aching sides as she
sat down near Ruth, when the little comedy was
over.</p>

<p>"Nor I, my dear. I think the old saying is
true, after all, that 'a little nonsense, now and
then, is relished by the best of men.'"</p>

<p>"This was certainly nonsense," admitted
Alice. "Oh, come over and let's see Miss Pennington
and Miss Dixon in that new play&mdash;'Parlor
Magic.' It's very interesting, and rather funny."</p>

<p>The two older actresses were to play in a little
scene where a young man&mdash;in this case Paul
Ardite&mdash;attempted to do some tricks he had been
studying. He was supposed to come to grief in
making an omelet in a silk hat, and have other
troubles when he tried to take rabbits out of parlor
vases, and such like nonsense.</p>

<p>This was one of the trick films&mdash;that is, it
was not a straight piece of work. It depended<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
for its success on the manipulation of the camera,
on substituting dummies for real persons or animals
at certain points, the interposition of films
and many other things too technical to put
into a book that is only intended to amuse
you.</p>

<p>"How are you?" asked Miss Pennington, as
Ruth and Alice came over to their side of the
studio. "You are looking quite well."</p>

<p>"And we are well," answered Alice. "We
want to see you act," for the filming had not
yet begun.</p>

<p>"For instruction or amusement?" asked Miss
Dixon, and her voice had something of a sneer
in it. She and her chum were not on the most
friendly terms with Ruth and Alice.</p>

<p>"Both amusement and instruction," responded
Alice, sweetly&mdash;in a doubly sweet voice under
the circumstances. "One can learn from anyone,
you know," and she pretended to be interested
in one of the tricks Paul was practicing
while getting ready for the camera.</p>

<p>Alice could say things with a double meaning
at times, and probably this was one of them.</p>

<p>"Oh!" was all Miss Dixon said, and then she
called: "Paul, come here; won't you? I want you
to fasten my glove."</p>

<p>"Certainly," he agreed, with a look at Alice<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
which was meant to say: "I don't want to do
this, but I can't very well get out of it."</p>

<p>Paul, I might add, had been quite interested
in Miss Dixon before the advent of Alice, and
the vaudeville actress rather resented the change.
She took advantage of every opportunity to
make Paul fetch and carry for her as he had been
wont to do.</p>

<p>The parlor magic play was successfully filmed
and then, as Alice and Ruth had some shopping to
do, to get their costumes ready for their appearance
before the camera next day, they prepared
to leave. They stopped for a moment, however,
to watch their father in his play&mdash;"A Heart's
Cavalier." This was rather a pretentious drama,
and called for really good acting, the nature of
which appealed to the veteran player.</p>

<p>It was really a delight to watch him, for he
gave a finished performance, and the loss of his
voice was no handicap here. He could whisper
the words, or utter them in a low tone, so that
the motion of his lips might be seen by the
audience.</p>

<p>If you have ever seen motion pictures, and I
am sure you all have, you know that often you
can tell exactly what the characters are saying
by watching the form of their lips.</p>

<p>Deaf persons, who have learned to know what<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
other persons are saying, merely by watching
their lips, are able to "hear" much more than
can the ordinary individual what goes on in
moving pictures. In this they have a distinct
advantage.</p>

<p>But of course the story the celluloid film tells
is mostly conveyed by the action of the characters,
and Mr. DeVere was an expert in this.</p>

<p>"Good-bye, Daddy," called Alice, when he
was out of the scene for a moment. "We'll be
back, and you can take us out to lunch."</p>

<p>"All right," he laughed. "Make your poor
old daddy spend his hard-earned money, will
you?"</p>

<p>"You know you're just crazy to do it," said
Ruth. "Come on Alice."</p>

<p>The next day called for hard work for both
the moving picture girls, and there were a number
of outdoor scenes to do. They were glad of
this change, however.</p>

<p>Some of the scenes Ruth and Alice had parts
in, as well as Paul Ardite, were filmed out in
Bronx Park, with the still natural wildness of
that beauty spot as background. One scene was
down near the beaver pond, and with the snow
on the ground, and the sleet still on the trees, the
pictures afterward turned out to be most effective.
Special permission had to be obtained to use the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
camera in the park, there being a rule against it.</p>

<p>Alice had one part which called for feeding the
birds with crumbs scattered over the snow. And,
just when they wanted this not a bird&mdash;even a
sparrow&mdash;was in sight. In vain they went to
different parts of the park, looking for some, and
scattered many crumbs.</p>

<p>"I guess we'll have to give it up, and come
back some other time," Russ said finally. "I don't
want to make another trip, either," he went on.
"It wastes so much time, and we're going to be
be very busy soon."</p>

<p>"What about those new plans?" asked Ruth.</p>

<p>"They are to be announced to-morrow, I believe,"
was the answer. "A lot of snow dramas
are to be filmed."</p>

<p>"Good!" cried Alice. "I love the snow."</p>

<p>"Oh, quick! There are some birds!" called
Ruth. "See, over there, Alice. Scatter the
crumbs!"</p>

<p>Russ had them in his pocket in readiness, and
soon the snow was covered. The birds did their
part well, and as Alice stood near them, throwing
crumbs to the hungry sparrows and starlings,
they fluttered about her, and flocked at her feet.</p>

<p>"Good!" cried Russ, who was busy with the
camera. "It couldn't be better. This will make
a fine film."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>Alice presented a pretty picture as she stood
there in her furs, scattering crumbs to the birds,
and the little feathered creatures proved the best
sort of actors, for they were not self-conscious,
and did not stop to peer at the camera, the
clicking of which they did not mind in the
least.</p>

<p>"Well, that's done; now I think we'll go back,"
Russ said, when he had ascertained, by looking
at the register on the side of the camera, that
enough feet of the film had been used on that
scene. For, in order to have each scene get its
proper amount of space, both as regards time
and length of film a strict watch is kept on how
much celluloid is used.</p>

<p>A manager, or director, will decide on the importance
of the various scenes, and then divide up
the film, giving so many feet to each act.</p>

<p>The standard length of film is a thousand
feet. It comes in thousand foot reels, but some
plays are so elaborate that two, three or even
seven reels have been given up to them. Great
scenic productions, such as "Quo Vadis?" use up
many thousand feet of film.</p>

<p>Russ and the two girls, with Paul, started
back from the Bronx. They were to stop in at
the studio, but on reaching there the girls found
that their father had gone home, leaving a note<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
saying he was going to see the doctor about his
throat.</p>

<p>"Poor daddy!" murmured Ruth. "He does
have such trouble!"</p>

<p>"Has Merley bothered him again?" asked
Russ.</p>

<p>"No, he has heard nothing from him," answered
Alice. "But daddy worries about it.
Five hundred <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'dollares'">dollars</ins> means more to him now
than five thousand may later. For I hope daddy
will get rich some day," she finished, with a
laugh.</p>

<p>The three walked on together to the subway,
and got out at the station nearest their house. On
the way they had to cross one of the surface car
lines, and, just as they reached the corner, they
heard a shout of alarm or warning, evidently directed
at someone in danger from an approaching
electric car.</p>

<p>"What is it?" cried Ruth, clinging to Alice.</p>

<p>"I don't know," answered the younger girl.
"Oh, yes, there it is!" she cried, pointing.</p>

<p>Three men were on the car tracks, and two of
them seemed to be trying to pull one away, out
of the path of an approaching car. The shouts
came from a number of pedestrians who had seen
the danger of the man.</p>

<p>The latter seemed to be caught by the foot<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
on the rail, though how this was possible was
difficult to understand, as the rail was flat.</p>

<p>The motorman was doing his best to stop the
car, but the rails were slippery and it was easily
<ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'seem'">seen</ins> that he could not do it. Then he added his
shouts to those of the others.</p>

<p>"Oh, he'll be killed!" cried Alice, covering
her face with her hands. Ruth had also turned
aside.</p>

<p>"No, he won't!" cried Russ, with conviction.
"They'll get him off, I think. There! He's free!
I guess they took off his shoe."</p>

<p>As he spoke the girls looked, and they saw
the man fall in a peculiar way, to one side, so
as to be out of the path of the car, which swept
past him. The vehicle, however, seemed to hit
him, but of this neither Russ nor the girls could
be sure.</p>

<p>"That's a queer accident," murmured Russ, as
he started toward the scene of it. "Come on,
girls."</p>

<p>Ruth and Alice went with him. There was
a little crowd about the fallen man, and at the
sight of the fellow's face Alice suddenly cried:</p>

<p>"Look! That is Dan Merley!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<h3>NEW PLANS</h3>


<p>Alice's announcement caused her sister to
start in surprise. Ruth looked as if she could
not understand, and Alice repeated:</p>

<p>"See, the man who fell is Dan Merley&mdash;the
one who says daddy owes him five hundred dollars."</p>

<p>"I believe you're right!" agreed Russ, who
had had a good look at the impudent fellow the
night he invaded the DeVere rooms. "And I
know one of those other men&mdash;at least by sight.
His name is Jagle. Let's see what is going on
here."</p>

<p>Fortunately no very large crowd gathered, so
the girls felt it would be proper for them to remain,
particularly as the accident was not of a
distressing nature.</p>

<p>The motorman had stopped his car and had
run back to the scene with the conductor.</p>

<p>"What's the matter here? What did you want<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
to get in the way of the car for, anyhow?" demanded
the motorman. He was nervously excited,
and the reaction at finding, after all, he
had not killed a man, made him rather angry.</p>

<p>"Matter? Matter enough, I should say!" replied
one of the men with Merley. "My friend
is badly hurt. Someone get an ambulance! Fripp,
you call one."</p>

<p>"That was Jagle who spoke," Russ whispered
to the girls. "But I don't know the other one."</p>

<p>"He doesn't seem to be badly hurt," remarked
the motorman. The conductor, with a little pad
and pencil, was getting the names of witnesses to
be used in case suit was brought. This is always
done by street car companies, in order to protect
themselves.</p>

<p>"Hurt? Of course he's hurt!" exclaimed the
man Russ called Jagle. "See that cut on his
head!"</p>

<p>There was a slight abrasion on Merley's forehead,
but it did not seem at all serious.</p>

<p>"Aren't you hurt, Dan?" asked Jagle.</p>

<p>"Of course I am!" was the answer. "I'm hurt
bad, too. Get me home, Jim."</p>

<p>"If he's hurt the best place for him is a hospital,"
remarked the motorman. "But I can't see
where he's hurt."</p>

<p>"I can't walk, I tell you," whined Merley, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
he attempted to get up, but fell back. One of
his friends caught him in his arms.</p>

<p>"There, you see! Of course he's hurt!" declared
Jagle. "Go call an ambulance, Fripp."</p>

<p>"I'll get an ambulance if he really needs one,"
spoke a policeman, who had just come up on
seeing the crowd. "Where are you hurt?"</p>

<p>"Something's the matter with my legs," declared
Merley. "I can't use my right one, and
the left one is hurt, too. My foot got caught
between the rail and a piece of ice, and I couldn't
get loose. My friends tried to help me, but they
couldn't get me away in time. I'm hurt, and I'm
hurt bad, I tell you! I think one of my legs must
be run over."</p>

<p>"Nothing like that!" declared the motorman.
"There's been no legs run over by my car!"</p>

<p>That was very evident.</p>

<p>"Get me away from here," groaned Merley.</p>

<p>"Well, if you're really hurt I'll call an ambulance
and have you taken to the hospital," offered
the policeman as he went to turn in a call.</p>

<p>"I sure am hurt," insisted Merley. "Why, I
can hardly move now," and he seemed to stiffen
all over, though there was no visible sign of injury.</p>

<p>"Why doesn't someone get a doctor?" a boy
in the crowd asked.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>"There'll be one in de hurry-up wagon!" exclaimed
another urchin. "A feller in a white
suit&mdash;dem's doctors. I know, cause me fadder
was in de 'ospital onct."</p>

<p>Merley's two friends carried him to a drug store
not far from the scene of the accident. Ruth
and Alice shrank back as he was borne past them,
for they feared he might recognize them, and
cause a scene. But if he saw them, which is
doubtful, he gave no sign.</p>

<p>"Here comes de hurry-up wagon!" cried the
lad who had thus designated the ambulance.
"Let's see 'em shove him on de stretcher! Say
dis is great!"</p>

<p>"I think we had better be going, Alice, dear,"
said Ruth. "Daddy wouldn't like us to be in
this crowd."</p>

<p>"Oh, I want to stay and see what happens. Besides,
it might be important," Alice objected.
"This is Dan Merley, who might make trouble
for papa. We ought to see what happens to him.
I think that whole accident was queer. He didn't
seem to be hit at all, and yet he says he can't
move. We ought to stay."</p>

<p>"If you want to go, I'll stay and let you know
what happens," offered Russ. "I don't mind."</p>

<p>"Perhaps that would be best," said Ruth.</p>

<p>"All right," agreed Alice, and she and her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
sister, with a last look at the crowd around the
ambulance, started for their apartment.</p>

<p>Russ came along a little later.</p>

<p>"What happened?" asked Ruth, when he had
knocked on the door of their hall and had been
admitted.</p>

<p>"Not much," he replied. "They took Merley
home, instead of to a hospital. He wouldn't go
to an institution, he said."</p>

<p>"Did those other two men go with him?"
asked Alice.</p>

<p>"Who, Fripp and Jagle? No, they wouldn't
be allowed to ride on the ambulance. But they
got a taxicab and went off in that. I heard Jagle
say to the ambulance surgeon, that he was a doctor,
and that he'd attend his friend when he got
him home."</p>

<p>"Is Jagle a doctor?" asked Alice. "He didn't
look like one."</p>

<p>"He's a <i>sort</i> of doctor," Russ replied. "I think
he's a quack, myself. I wouldn't have him for
a sick cat. But he calls himself a doctor and
surgeon. So that's all that happened."</p>

<p>"It was enough, anyhow," remarked Ruth. "I
don't like to see anybody hurt."</p>

<p>"I'm not so sure that fellow <i>was</i> hurt," said
Russ, slowly.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" Alice asked, curiously.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, he might have <i>imagined</i> he was. I
guess he was pretty well scared at seeing that
car come down on him. But I watched when
he was put in the ambulance and he seemed as
well as either of his friends. Only he kept insisting
that he could not walk."</p>

<p>"It was certainly a queer accident," said Alice.
"But, in spite of the fact that he is a bad man,
and wants to make trouble for daddy, I hope he
isn't seriously hurt."</p>

<p>"I don't believe it is serious," said Russ.
"But it might easily have been, though, if he
had fallen in front of the car instead of away
from it."</p>

<p>"Well, there is nothing that hasn't its good
side," remarked Ruth. "Emerson's idea of the
law of compensation works out very nicely in
this case."</p>

<p>"Kindly translate, sister mine," invited Alice,
laughingly.</p>

<p>"Why, you know Emerson holds that one advantage
makes up for each defect. In this case
Merley has had an accident&mdash;a defect. That may
cause him to stop annoying daddy&mdash;a distinct
advantage to us."</p>

<p>"Oh, Ruth, how queer you are!" exclaimed
Alice with a laugh. "I never heard of such an
idea."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>"Who was this Emerson&mdash;a moving picture
fellow?" asked Russ.</p>

<p>"No, he was a great writer," explained Ruth.
"I'll let you take one of his books."</p>

<p>"I wish you would," said Russ, seriously. "I
never had much of a chance to get an education,
but I like to know things."</p>

<p>"So do I," agreed Ruth. "I never tire of
Emerson."</p>

<p>Mr. DeVere was surprised when he heard
about the accident to Merley.</p>

<p>"I can't understand it," said the girls' father.
"He must have been hurt, and yet&mdash;er&mdash;was he
in a sensible condition, Russ?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, he seemed to be himself, all right,"
the young moving picture operator replied,
thoughtfully. "I haven't gotten to the bottom
of it myself."</p>

<p>And indeed it developed that there was a
strange plot back of the accident&mdash;a plot which
involved the moving picture girls in an amazing
way, as will soon appear.</p>

<p>But puzzle over the odd accident as they might,
neither Mr. DeVere, his daughters, nor Russ
could understand what it involved.</p>

<p>"At any rate, as you say, Ruth," the actor
remarked with a smile, "there is some compensation.
He may not annoy me for some time;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
and, meanwhile, I may think of a plan to prove
I really paid that money."</p>

<p>"I hope so, Daddy!" she exclaimed. "Is
your throat any better?"</p>

<p>"Yes, much," he replied with a smile. "Dr.
Rathby is going to try a new kind of spray treatment,
and I had the first one this afternoon. It
helped me wonderfully."</p>

<p>"That's good!" exclaimed Alice.</p>

<p>The next day's papers contained a slight reference
to the accident. It was not important
enough to warrant much space, and about all
that was said was that Merley claimed to have
received an injury that made him helpless,
though its nature was a puzzle to the physician
sent around by the street car company.</p>

<p>"Well, if he's helpless, and the Lord knows
I wish that to no man," said Mr. DeVere, reverently,
"he will not come here bothering you girls
again. If he confines his attacks to me I do not
so much mind, but he must leave you alone."</p>

<p>"That's what I say!" cried Russ.</p>

<p>When Mr. DeVere and his daughters arrived
at the moving picture studio that afternoon, for
they were not to report until then, they found
notices posted, requesting all members of the
company to remain after rehearsal to hear an
"important announcement."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>"I wonder what it can be?" said Ruth.</p>

<p>"Probably it's about the new plans Mr. Pertell
has been working on," suggested Alice.</p>

<p>"I think so," Russ said. He knew something
of them, but had not permission to reveal them.</p>

<p>And this proved to be the case. After the
day's work was ended, and it included the filming
of several scenes for important dramas, Mr.
Pertell called his players together, and said:</p>

<p>"Ladies and gentlemen&mdash;also Tommy and
Nellie, for you will be in on this, I hope&mdash;we
are going to leave New York City again, and be
together in a new place to make a series of
plays."</p>

<p>"Leave New York!" gasped Miss Pennington.</p>

<p>"I hope we don't go to Oak Farm again!"
cried Miss Dixon. "I want to be in some place
where I can get a lobster now and then."</p>

<p>"There will be no lobsters at Deerfield!" said
Mr. Pertell, with a smile, "unless there are some
of the canned variety."</p>

<p>"How horrid!" complained Miss Pennington.</p>

<p>"Will there be deers there?" asked Tommy,
with big eyes.</p>

<p>"I think there will, sonny," answered the
manager.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>"Reindeers&mdash;like Santa Claus has?" little
Nellie wanted to know.</p>

<p>"Well, I guess so!" laughed Mr. Pertell.
"At any rate, I plan to take you all there."</p>

<p>"Where is Deerfield, if one may ask?" inquired
Miss Dixon, pertly.</p>

<p>"Deerfield is a sort of backwoods settlement,
in one of our New England States," explained
the manager. "It is rather isolated, but I want
to go there to get some scenes for moving pictures
with good snow, and ice effects as backgrounds."</p>

<p>"Are there good hotels there?" Miss Pennington
demanded.</p>

<p>"We are going to stop in a big hunting lodge,
that I have hired for the occasion," Mr. Pertell
replied. "I think you will like it very much."</p>

<p>"Hold on! One moment!" exclaimed Mr.
Sneed, the grouchy actor. "You may count me
out of this! I shall go to no backwoods, in the
middle of winter, and freeze. I cannot stand the
cold. I shall resign at once!"</p>

<p>"One moment. Before you decide that, I have
something else to say to you," said Mr. Pertell,
and there was a smile on his face.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<h3>OFF TO THE WOODS</h3>


<p>The moving picture players looked curiously
at the manager, and then at Mr. Sneed. They
were used to this action on his part, and also on
the part of Mr. Bunn&mdash;that of resigning when
anything did not suit them. But matters with
either of them seldom went farther than the mere
threat.</p>

<p>"I know it will not be as pleasant, as regards
weather conditions, at Elk Lodge, Deerfield, as
it was at Oak Farm," said Mr. Pertell. "But
the lodge is a big building, very quaint and picturesque,
I have been told, and it has all the
comforts, and many of the conveniences, of life.
There are big, open fireplaces, and plenty of logs
to burn. So you will not freeze."</p>

<p>"Open fires are always cold," complained Mr.
Sneed. "You roast on one side, and freeze on
the other."</p>

<p>"Oh, I think it won't be quite as bad as that,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>"
laughed the manager. "But that is not all I have
to say. In consideration of the fact that there
will be some inconveniences, in spite of all I can
do, I am willing to make an increase of ten per
cent. in the salaries of all of you, including
Tommy and Nellie," and he smiled at the two
children.</p>

<p>"Oh, goodie! I'm going!" cried the small
lad.</p>

<p>"So'm I," voiced his sister.</p>

<p>There was a moment of silence, while all the
members of the company looked at Mr. Sneed,
who had raised the first contention. He seemed
to think that it was necessary for him to say
something.</p>

<p>"Ah&mdash;ahem!" he began.</p>

<p>"Yes?" spoke Mr. Pertell, questioningly.</p>

<p>"In view of all the facts, and er&mdash;that I would
have to give two weeks' notice, and under all the
circumstances, I think&mdash;er&mdash;I will withdraw my
resignation, if you will allow me," the grouchy
actor went on, in a lofty manner.</p>

<p>"Ah!" laughed Mr. Pertell. "Then we will
consider it settled, and you may all begin to pack
up for Elk Lodge as soon as you please."</p>

<p>"When are we to leave?" asked Mr. DeVere.</p>

<p>"In a few days now. I have one more play
I want to stage in New York, and then we will<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
leave for the country where we can study snow
and ice effects to better advantage than here. We
want to get out into the open. Russ, I must have
a talk with you about films. I think, in view of
the fact that the lights out in the open, reflected
by the snow, will be very intense and high, a little
change in the film and the stop of the camera
will be necessary."</p>

<p>"I think so myself," agreed the young moving
picture operator. "In fact, I have been working
on a little device that I can attach to our cameras
to cut down the amount of light automatically.
It consists of a selenium plate with a battery attachment&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, spare us the dreadful details!" interrupted
Miss Pennington, who was of a rather
frivolous nature.</p>

<p>"Well, there is no longer need of detaining
you," spoke Mr. Pertell. "Work for the day is
over. We will meet again to-morrow and film
'A Mother's Sorrow,' and that will be the last
New York play for some time. I presume it will
take a week to get ready to go to Deerfield, as
there are many details to look after."</p>

<p>"Oh, I just can't wait until it's time to go to
the backwoods!" cried Alice, as she and Ruth
were on their way home that evening. "Aren't
you crazy about it, sister mine?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, not exactly <i>crazy</i>, Alice. You do use
such&mdash;er&mdash;such strong expressions!"</p>

<p>"Well, I have strong feelings, I suppose."</p>

<p>"I know, but you must be more&mdash;more conservative."</p>

<p>"I know you were going to say 'lady-like,'
but you didn't dare," laughed Alice.</p>

<p>"Well, consider it said, my dear," went on
Ruth, in all seriousness, for she felt that she
must, in a measure, play the part of a mother
to her younger sister.</p>

<p>"I don't want to consider anything!" laughed
Alice, "except the glorious fun we are going to
have. Oh, Ruth, even the prospect of that dreadful
Dan Merley making daddy pay the debt over
again can't dampen my spirits now. I'm so
happy!"</p>

<p>She threw her arms about Ruth and attempted
a few turns of the one-step glide.</p>

<p>"Oh, stop! I'm slipping!" cried Ruth, for
the sidewalk was icy. "Alice, let me go!"</p>

<p>"Not until you take a few more steps! Now
dip!"</p>

<p>"But, Alice! I'm going to fall! I know I
am! There! I told you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But Ruth did not get a chance to use the favorite
expression of Mr. Sneed, if such was her
intention. For she really was about to fall when<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
a young man, who was passing, caught her, and
saved her from a tumble.</p>

<p>"Oh!" she gasped, in confusion, as she recovered
her balance.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon," laughed the young fellow,
with sparkling eyes.</p>

<p>"I should beg yours!" faltered Ruth, with a
blush.</p>

<p>"It was all my fault&mdash;I wanted her to dance!"
cried Alice, willing to accept her share of the
blame.</p>

<p>"Yes, this weather makes one feel like dancing,"
the young fellow agreed, and then with a
bow he passed on.</p>

<p>"Alice how could you?" cried Ruth.</p>

<p>"How could I what?"</p>

<p>"Make me do that."</p>

<p>"I didn't mean to. Really, he was nice;
wasn't he? And say, did you notice his
eyes?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Alice, you are hopeless!" and Ruth had
to laugh.</p>

<p>The two moving picture girls reached home
without further mishap, if mishap that could be
called, though all the way Alice insisted on
waltzing about happily, and trying in vain to
get Ruth to join in, and try the new steps.
Passersby more than once turned to look at the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
two pretty girls, who made a most attractive
picture.</p>

<p>The drama next day was successfully filmed
and then followed a sort of week's vacation,
while the picture players prepared for the trip
to the woods.</p>

<p>They were to go by train to Hampton Junction,
the nearest station to Deerfield. This last
was only a small settlement once the center of
an important lumber industry, but now turned
into a hunting preserve, owned by a number of
rich men. As the Lodge was not in use this
season, Mr. Pertell had engaged it for his company.</p>

<p>In due time the baggage was all packed, the
various "properties" had been shipped by Pop
Snooks and everything was ready for the trip.
The journey from the railroad station at Hampton
Junction to Elk Lodge, in Deerfield, was to
be made in big four-horse sleds, several of them
having been engaged, for it was reported that
the snow was deep in the woods. Winter had
set in with all its severity there.</p>

<p>Finally all the members of the company were
gathered at the Grand Central Terminal, New
York. The players attracted considerable attention,
for there was that air of the theater about
them which always seems so fascinating to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
outsider, who knows so little of the really hard
work that goes on behind the footlights. Most
of the glitter is in front, in spite of appearances.</p>

<p>"Why, it's like setting off for Oak Farm!"
remarked Alice, as she stood beside her sister,
Paul and Russ.</p>

<p>"Only there isn't any mystery in prospect,"
spoke Paul. "I wonder how the Apgars are getting
on, now that their farm is safe?"</p>

<p>"They're probably sitting about a warm fire,
talking about it," Russ said.</p>

<p>"There may be just as much of a mystery in
the backwoods as there was at Oak Farm, if we
can only come across it," suggested Alice. "I
wish we could discover something queer."</p>

<p>"Oh, Alice!" protested Ruth.</p>

<p>Mr. Sneed was observed to be walking about,
peering at the various sign boards on which the
destination of trains was given.</p>

<p>"What are you looking for?" asked Russ.</p>

<p>"I want to see that we don't start out on track
thirteen as we did when we went to Oak Farm,
and had the wreck," the actor answered. "I've
had enough of hoodoos."</p>

<p>"You're all right this time&mdash;we leave from
track twenty-seven," called Mr. Pertell. "All
aboard for Deerfield and Elk Lodge!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<h3>A BREAKDOWN</h3>


<p>There was snow everywhere. Never could
Ruth, Alice, and the other members of the Comet
Film Company remember so much at one time.
They seemed to have entered the Polar regions.</p>

<p>Along the tracks of the railroad the white
flakes were piled in deep drifts, and when they
swept out from a patch of woodland, and had a
view across the fields, or down into some valley,
they could see a long, unbroken stretch of white.</p>

<p>"It sure is some snow," observed Russ, who
sat in the seat with Ruth, while Paul had pre-empted
a place beside Alice. This last in spite
of the fact that Miss Dixon invitingly had a
seat ready for the young actor beside herself.
But she was forced to be content with a novel
for companionship.</p>

<p>"Yes, and we're going to get more snow,"
remarked Mr. Sneed, who sat behind Russ.
"We'll get so much that the train will be de<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>layed,
and we'll have to stay on it all night; that's
what will happen."</p>

<p>"Und ve vill starf den; ain't dot so?" inquired
Mr. Switzer, with a jolly laugh from
across the aisle. "Ve vill starf alretty; vill ve
not, mine gloomy friendt?"</p>

<p>"We sure will," predicted the grouch of the
company. "They took the dining car off at the
last station, and I understand there isn't another
one to be had until we get to Hampton Junction.
We sure will starve!"</p>

<p>"Ha! Dot is vot ve vill <i>not</i> do!" laughed
Mr. Switzer, with conviction. "See, I haf alretty
t'ought of dot, und I haf provided. Here
are pretzels!" and he produced a large bag of
them from his grip. "Ve vill not starf!"</p>

<p>"Ha! Pretzels!" scoffed Mr. Sneed. "I
never eat them!"</p>

<p>"Maybe you vill before you starf!" chuckled
Mr. Switzer, as he replaced them. "I like dem
much!"</p>

<p>The other members of the company laughed&mdash;all
but Mr. Sneed and Wellington Bunn. The
former went forward to consult a brakeman as
to the prospects of the train becoming snowbound,
while Mr. Bunn, who wore his tall hat,
and was bundled up in a fur coat, huddled close
to the window, and doubtless dreamed of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
days when he had played Shakespearean r&ocirc;les;
and wondered if he would play them again.</p>

<p>The train went on, not that any great speed
was attained, for the grade was up hill, and there
had been heavy storms. There was also the prospect
of more snow, and this, amid the rugged
hills of New England, was not reassuring.</p>

<p>"But we expect hard weather up here," said
Mr. Pertell to his company. "The more snow
and ice we have, the better pictures we can get."</p>

<p>"That's right!" agreed Russ.</p>

<p>"Humph! I'm beginning to wish I hadn't
come," growled Mr. Sneed, who had received
information from a brakeman to the effect that
trains were often snowbound in that part of the
State.</p>

<p>A few feathery flakes began falling now, and
there was the promise of more in the clouds
overhead, and in the sighing of the North wind.</p>

<p>"Does your throat hurt you much, Daddy?"
asked Ruth, as she noticed her father wrapping
a silk handkerchief closer about his neck.</p>

<p>"Just a little; I think it is the unusual cold,"
he replied. "But I do not mind it. The air is
sharper here than in New York; but it is drier.
Perhaps it may do me good. I think I will use
my spray," and he got out his atomizer.</p>

<p>There were not many passengers beside the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
members of the film theatrical company in the
car in which Ruth and her sister rode. Among
them, however, were two young ladies, about the
age of Alice, and as Ruth went down the aisle
once, to get a drink of water, she noted that one
of the strangers appeared to be ill.</p>

<p>"Pardon me," spoke Ruth, with ready sympathy,
"but can I do anything to help you?"</p>

<p>"She has a bad headache," replied the other.
"My sister always gets one when she travels.
Fortunately we have not much farther to go."</p>

<p>"Oh, Helen, I shall be so glad when we get
there," said the suffering one.</p>

<p>"Never mind, Mabel, we will soon be there,"
soothed the other.</p>

<p>"If you don't mind&mdash;I'd like to give you my
smelling salts," offered Ruth. "They always
help me when I have a headache, which is seldom,
I'm glad to say."</p>

<p>"I wish I could say that," murmured the afflicted
one.</p>

<p>"Suppose you let me give the bottle to you,"
suggested Ruth. "I'll have my sister bring some
spirits of <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'colonge'">cologne</ins>, too. Then you can bathe your
head."</p>

<p>"You are very kind," responded the other.</p>

<p>Soon the four girls were in the ladies' compartment
of the parlor car in which the picture<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
company was traveling. There was a lounge
there, and on this the girl called Mabel was soon
receiving the ministrations of the others.</p>

<p>Her head was bathed in the fragrant cologne,
and the use of the smelling salts relieved the
slight feeling of indisposition that accompanied
the headache.</p>

<p>"I feel so much better now," she declared,
after a little. "I&mdash;I think I could sleep."</p>

<p>"That would be the best thing for you, my
dear," said Ruth, as she smoothed her hair.
"Come," she whispered to the others, "we will
sit back here and let her rest," and she motioned
them to come into the curtained-off recess of the
compartment.</p>

<p>There the other girl said that she and her
sister were on their way to visit relatives over
the holidays. They were Mabel and Helen Madison,
of New York.</p>

<p>"And right after Christmas we're going to
Florida," Helen confided to Ruth and Alice.</p>

<p>"Oh, it must be lovely there, under the
palms!" exclaimed the latter. "I do so want to
go."</p>

<p>"It is quite a contrast to this, I should imagine,"
remarked Ruth, as she gazed out of the
window on the snowy scene.</p>

<p>"Does your company ever get as far as Flor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>ida?"
asked Helen, for Ruth and Alice had told
her their profession.</p>

<p>"We haven't yet," replied Ruth, "though
once, when we were small, daddy played in St.
Augustine, and we were there. But I don't remember
anything about it."</p>

<p>"We are going to a little resort on Lake Kissimmee,"
said Helen Madison. "Perhaps we
may see you there, if you ever make pictures in
Florida."</p>

<p>"I hardly think we are going that far," observed
Ruth. "But if we do we shall look for
you."</p>

<p>Ruth little realized then how prophetic her
words were, nor how she and Alice would actually
"look" for the two girls.</p>

<p>A little later Mabel awakened from a doze,
and announced that her head felt much better.
Then, as it would soon be time for her and her
sister to get off, for they were nearing their destination,
they went back to their seats to get their
luggage in readiness.</p>

<p>"I like them; don't you?" asked Alice, as she
and Ruth rejoined their friends.</p>

<p>"Indeed I do! They seem very sweet girls.
I would like to meet them again."</p>

<p>"So would I. Perhaps we shall. It would
be lovely if we could go to Florida, after our<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
winter work is over. I'm going to ask Mr. Pertell
if there's any likelihood of our doing so."</p>

<p>But Alice did not get the opportunity just
then, as she and Ruth went to the door to bid
their new girl acquaintances good-bye. Then
came the announcement that in a short time
Hampton Junction would be reached.</p>

<p>"Better be getting your possessions together,"
advised Mr. Pertell to his company. "It is getting
late and I don't want to have you travel too
much after dark."</p>

<p>The train came to a stop at Hampton Junction,
and from the car emerged the picture players.
Ranged alongside the small building that
served as the depot were several large sleighs,
known in that country as "pungs," the bodies
being filled with clean straw. There were four
horses to each, and the jingle of their bells made
music on the wintry air.</p>

<p>"Oh, we're going to have a regular straw
ride!" cried Alice, clapping her hands at the
sight of the comfortable-looking sleighs. "Isn't
this jolly, Ruth?"</p>

<p>"I'm sure it will be, yes. Come now, have
you everything?"</p>

<p>"Everything, and more too!"</p>

<p>"Daddy, are you all right?" went on Ruth,
for she had gotten into the habit, of late, of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
looking after her father, who seemed to lean
on her more and more as she grew older.</p>

<p>"Everything, daughter," he replied. "And
my throat feels much better. I think the cold
air is doing it good."</p>

<p>"That's fine!" she laughed, happily. "Now
I wonder which of these sleighs is ours?"</p>

<p>"I'll tell you in a minute," said Mr. Pertell.
"I want to see the lodge-keeper. Oh, there he
is! Hello, Jake Macksey!" he called to the
sturdy man, in big boots, who was stalking about
among the sleds, "is everything all right for
us?"</p>

<p>"Everything, Mr. Pertell," was the hearty answer.
"We'll have you out to Elk Lodge in a
jiffy. My wife has got a lot of stuff cooked up,
for she thought you'd be hungry."</p>

<p>"Indeed we are!" grumbled Mr. Sneed.</p>

<p>"But if dere iss stuff cooked I can safe mine
pretzels!" chuckled Mr. Switzer.</p>

<p>The baggage was stowed in one sled, and in
the others the members of the picture company
distributed themselves.</p>

<p>"All right?" asked Jake Macksey, who was
a veteran guide and hunter, and in charge of Elk
Lodge.</p>

<p>"All ready!" answered Mr. Pertell.</p>

<p>"Drive lively now, boys!" called the hunter.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
"It's getting late, and will soon be dark, and
the roads aren't any too good."</p>

<p>"Oh my!" groaned Mr. Sneed. "I'm sure
something will happen!"</p>

<p>With cracks of the whips, and a jingling of
sleighbells, the little cavalcade started off. The
gloom settled slowly down, but Ruth and Alice
helped dispel it by singing lively songs. Over
the snow-covered road they went, now on a comparatively
level place, and again down into some
hollow where the drifts were deep. The horses
pulled nobly.</p>

<p>They came to a narrow place in the road,
where the snow was piled high on either side.
There was room for but one sled at a time.</p>

<p>"I hope we don't meet anyone here," said Mr.
Macksey. "If they do we'll have a hard job
passing. G'lang there!" he called to his horses.</p>

<p>They were half-way through the snow defile,
when the leading sleigh, in which rode Ruth and
Alice, swerved to one side. There was a crashing
sound, a splintering of wood, and the two
forward horses went down in a heap.</p>

<p>"Whoa! Whoa!" called Mr. Macksey, as he
reined in the others.</p>

<p>"What's happened?" asked Mr. DeVere.</p>

<p>"Some sort of a breakdown," answered the
hunter.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>"Serious?" the actor wanted to know, trying
to peer ahead in the gloom.</p>

<p>"I can't tell yet," was the answer. "Here,
can someone hold the reins while I get out?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"I will," offered Russ, and he held the rear
team. The horses who had fallen had struggled
to their feet and were quiet now. But the front
part of the sled seemed to have sagged into the
snow.</p>

<p>"I thought so!" exclaimed Mr. Macksey, as
he got up after peering under the vehicle. "No
going on like this."</p>

<p>"What happened?" asked Alice.</p>

<p>"One of the forward runners has broken.
There must have been a defect in it I didn't
notice."</p>

<p>"Can't we go on?" asked Mr. Sneed.</p>

<p>"Not very well," was the answer. "We've
broken down, and unfortunately we're the leading
sleigh. I don't know how to get the others
past it."</p>

<p>"Well, I knew something would happen,"
sighed the human grouch. And he seemed quite
gratified that his prediction had been verified.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<h3>THE BLIZZARD</h3>


<p>The two other sleds had, as a matter of necessity,
come to a halt behind the first one. The
defile in the snow was so narrow that there could
be no passing. Those who had broken the road
through the drifts had not been wise enough to
make a wide path, and now the consequences
must be taken.</p>

<p>In fact it would have been a little difficult to
make at this point a path wide enough for two
sleighs. The road went between two rocky walls,
and though in the summer, when there was no
snow, two vehicles could squeeze past, in the
winter the piling up of the snow on either side
made an almost impassable barrier.</p>

<p>To turn out to right or left was out of the
question, for the snow was so deep that the
horses would have floundered helplessly in it.</p>

<p>"Well, what's to be done?" asked Mr. De<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>Vere,
as he buttoned his coat collar up around his
neck, and looked at his two daughters.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I'll have to ask you all to get
out," said Mr. Macksey. "I want to get a better
look at that broken runner, and see if it's possible
to mend it. Bring up a lantern," he called
to one of the drivers of the other sleds. "We'll
soon need it."</p>

<p>The moving picture players in the broken-down
sled piled out into the snow. Fortunately
they had come prepared for rough weather, and
wore stout shoes. Ruth and Alice, as well as
Russ and Paul, laughed at the plight, and Mr.
Switzer, with a chuckle, exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Ha! Maybe mine pretzels vill come in useful
after all!"</p>

<p>"That's no joke&mdash;maybe they will," observed
Mr. Sneed, gloomily. "We may have to stay
here all night."</p>

<p>"Oh, we could walk to Elk Lodge if we had
to," put in Mr. Macksey, as he took the lantern
which the other driver brought up.</p>

<p>"It wouldn't be very pleasant," replied Mr.
Sneed, "with darkness soon to be here, and a
storm coming up."</p>

<p>"You're right about the storm, I'm afraid,"
answered the veteran hunter. "I don't like the
looks of the weather a bit. And it sure will be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
dark soon. But we'll have a look at this sled,"
he went on. "Give me a hand here, Tom and
Dick," he called to the other drivers, who had
left their teams.</p>

<p>They managed to prop up the sled, so a better
view could be had of the forward runner. Then
the extent of the damage was made plain. One
whole side had given way, and was useless. It
could not even be patched up.</p>

<p>"Too bad!" declared the hunter. "Now, if
it had only been the rear sled it wouldn't worry
me so.</p>

<p>"For then we could pile the stuff from the
back sled into the others, and go on, even if we
were a bit crowded. But with the front sled
blocking this narrow road, I don't see how we
are to go on."</p>

<p>"If we could only jump the two rear sleds
over this broken one, it would be all right," said
Alice. "It's like one of those moving block
puzzles, where you try to get the squares in
a certain order without lifting any of them
out."</p>

<p>"That's it," agreed Mr. Macksey. "But it's
no easy matter to jump two big sleds, and eight
horses, over another sled and four horses. I've
played checkers, but never like that," he added.</p>

<p>"But we must do something," insisted Mr.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
Pertell. "I can't have my company out like
this all night. We must get on to Elk Lodge,
somehow."</p>

<p>"Well, I don't see how you're going to do it,"
responded the hunter. "You could walk, of
course; but you couldn't take your baggage, and
you wouldn't like that."</p>

<p>"Walk? Never! I protest against that!" exclaimed
Mr. Bunn.</p>

<p>"'He doth protest too much!'" quoted Paul,
in a low voice. "Come on, Ruth&mdash;Alice&mdash;shall
we walk?"</p>

<p>"I'd like to do it&mdash;I'm getting cold standing
here," cried Alice, stamping her feet on the edge
of the road. "Will you, Ruth?"</p>

<p>"I'm afraid we'd better not&mdash;at least until we
talk to daddy, my dear," was the low-voiced answer.
"Perhaps they can get the sled fixed."</p>

<p>But it did not seem so, for Mr. Macksey, with
a puzzled look on his face, was talking earnestly
to the two drivers. The accident had happened
at a most unfortunate time and place.</p>

<p>"We can't even turn around and go back a
different road, the way it is," said the hunter.
"There isn't room to turn, and everybody knows
you can't back a pung very far before getting
stuck."</p>

<p>"Then what are we to do?" asked Mr. Pertell.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>The hunter did not answer for a minute. Then
he said:</p>

<p>"Well, we've got twelve horses here, and I
can manage to squeeze the two rear teams past
the stalled sled. Then if you'd like to take
chances riding them to Elk Lodge&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Never!" cried Mr. Bunn, with lively recollections
of a time he had ridden a mule at Oak
Farm. "I shall stay here forever, first!"</p>

<p>"Well, if you don't want to do that," said
Mr. Macksey, and to tell the truth few members
of the company seemed in favor of the idea, "if
you don't want to do that I might ride on ahead
and get a spare sleigh I have at the Lodge. I
could get back here before very late, and we'd
get home sooner or later."</p>

<p>"And we would have to stay here?" asked
Mr. DeVere.</p>

<p>"I see no help for it. There are plenty of
blankets in the sleds, and you can huddle down
in the straw and keep warm. I'll get back as
soon as I can."</p>

<p>There really seemed nothing else to do, and,
after talking it over, this plan was practically
decided on. But something happened to change
it. The wind had been rising constantly, and the
snow was ever falling thicker and faster. The
players could see only a little way ahead now
from the place where they were stalled.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>"This would make a good film, if you could
get it," remarked Paul to Russ.</p>

<p>"Too dark," replied the camera operator.
"Do you know, I don't like this," he went on
in a low voice to the young actor.</p>

<p>"You don't like what?" Paul wanted to
know.</p>

<p>"The way this weather is acting. I think
there's going to be a big storm, and here we
are, stalled out in the open. It will be hard
for the girls and the women, to say nothing of
Tommy and Nellie."</p>

<p>"That's what it will, Russ; but what can be
done?"</p>

<p>As he spoke there came a sudden fierce rush
of wind and a flurry of snow. It took the
breaths of all, and instinctively they turned from
it, for the snow stung their faces. The horses,
too, disliked to face the stinging blast, and shifted
their places.</p>

<p>"Get behind such shelter as you can!" cried
Mr. Macksey, above the roar of the storm. "This
is a genuine blizzard and it's death to be unprotected.
Get into the sleds, and cover up with
the blankets. I'll have to go for help!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>

<h3>AT ELK LODGE</h3>


<p>The warning by Mr. Macksey, no less than
the sudden blast of the storm, struck terror to
the hearts of not only the moving picture girls,
but to all the other players. For it was something
to which they were not used&mdash;that terrible
sweep of wind and blinding snow.</p>

<p>There had been heavy storms in New York,
but there the big buildings cut off the force of
the wind, except perhaps in some street canyon.
But in the backwoods, on this stretch of open
fields, there was no protection except that furnished
by nature; or, in this case, by the sleds.</p>

<p>For a moment after the veteran hunter had
called his warning no one moved. They all
seemed paralyzed by fear. Then Mr. Macksey
called again:</p>

<p>"Into shelter, every one of you! What do
you mean; standing there in this storm? Get
under the blankets&mdash;crouch down at the side of
the sleds. I'll go for help."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>"But you&mdash;you'll freeze to death&mdash;I can't
permit you to go!" protested Mr. Pertell, yelling
the words into the other's ear, to make himself
heard above the storm.</p>

<p>"No, I'm used to this sort of thing!" the
hunter replied. "I know a short cut to the lodge,
and I can protect myself against the wind. I'll
go."</p>

<p>"I don't like it!" repeated Mr. Pertell, while
Mr. Macksey was forcing him back toward the
protecting sled.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the others, now, if never before,
feeling the need of shelter, were struggling
through the blinding snow toward the broken sled,
from which they had wandered a short time before
while listening to the attempts made at solving
the problem of getting on.</p>

<p>"Isn't this awful!" gasped Ruth, as she clung
to Alice.</p>

<p>"Awful? It's just glorious!" cried the
young girl. "I wouldn't have missed it for
worlds."</p>

<p>"Oh, Alice, how can you say so? We may
all die in this terrible storm!"</p>

<p>"I'm not going to think anything of the
kind!" returned the other. "We'll get out of it,
somehow, and laugh at ourselves afterward for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
being so silly as to be afraid. Oh, this is
great!"</p>

<p>She was really glorying in the fierce outburst
of nature. Perhaps she did not understand, or
appreciate, it, for she had never seen anything
like it before, and in this case ignorance might
have been akin to bliss.</p>

<p>But the others, especially the drivers of the
two sleds, with anxious looks on their cold faces,
were trying to seek the shelter they so much
needed, and also look to the restless horses. For
the animals were now almost frantic with their
desire to get away from that cutting wind and
stinging snow.</p>

<p>"Unhitch 'em all!" roared Mr. Macksey to
his men. "Take the horses from the sleds and
get 'em back of as much shelter as you can find.
Otherwise they may bolt and upset something.
I'll take old Bald-face, and see if I can't get some
kind of help."</p>

<p>Though what sort of aid he could bring to
the picture actors in this time of storm and stress
he hardly knew. But he was not going to give
up without trying.</p>

<p>Ruth and Alice were trying to struggle back
through the snow to their sled, and not making
very successful work of it, when they felt arms<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
at their sides helping them, and Russ and Paul
came along.</p>

<p>"Fierce; isn't it!" cried Russ in Ruth's ear.</p>

<p>"Awful, and yet this sister of mine pretends
that she likes it."</p>

<p>"I do!" declared Alice. "It's glorious. I
can't really believe it's a blizzard."</p>

<p>"It's the beginning of one, though," Paul assured
her. "I hear the drivers saying so. Their
blizzards up here start in with a squall like this,
and soon develop into a bad storm. This isn't
at its worst yet."</p>

<p>"Well, I hope I see the worst of it!" said
Alice.</p>

<p>"Oh, how can you so tempt fate?" asked
Ruth, seriously.</p>

<p>"I'm not tempting fate, but I mean I do like
to see a great storm&mdash;that is, if I'm protected, as
I am now," and Alice laughed through the whirling
snow into Paul's face, for he had wrapped
a fold of his big ulster about her.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear!" sighed Ruth.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" asked Russ, anxiously.</p>

<p>"I'm so worried."</p>

<p>"Don't be&mdash;yet," he said, reassuringly.</p>

<p>"But we may be snowed in here for a week!"</p>

<p>"Never mind&mdash;Mr. Switzer still has his pretzels,
I believe."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>She could not help laughing, in spite of their
distress.</p>

<p>"Oh, poor daddy!" cried Alice, as she reached
the sled, and Paul prepared to help her in, "he
is trying to protect his poor throat." Mr. DeVere
wore a heavy coat, the collar of which he
had turned up, but even this seemed little protection,
and he was now tying a silk handkerchief
about his collar.</p>

<p>"I have the very thing for him!" cried Paul,
taking off a muffler he wore.</p>

<p>"Oh, but you'll need that!" protested Alice,
quickly.</p>

<p>"Not a bit of it&mdash;I'm as warm as toast," he
answered. "Here you are, sir!" he called to
Mr. DeVere, and when the latter, after a weak
resistance, had accepted it (for he was really suffering
from the cold), Alice thanked Paul with
a look that more than repaid him for his knightly
self-sacrifice.</p>

<p>The players were by now in the sled, which,
in its damaged condition, had been let down as
nearly level as possible. The blankets were pulled
up over the side, and Mr. Macksey was preparing
to unhitch one of the horses, and set off for help.
Then one of the drivers gave a sudden cry, and
came running up to his employer.</p>

<p>"Look!" he shouted. "The wind's shifted.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
It's blowing right across the top of this cut now.
We'll be protected down here!"</p>

<p>This was indeed true. At the beginning of
the squall, which was working up to a blizzard,
the wind had swept up the canyon-like defile between
the hills of earth and snow. But now the
direction of the gale had shifted and was sweeping
across the top of the depression. Thus those
at the bottom were, in a measure, protected from
the blast.</p>

<p>"By hickory!" exclaimed Mr. Macksey,
"that's right. The wind has changed. Folks,
you'll be all right for a while down here, until
I can get help."</p>

<p>"Must you go?" asked Ruth, for now they
could talk with more ease. Indeed, so fiercely
was the snow sweeping across the top of
the gulch that little of it fell into the depression.</p>

<p>"Oh, sure, I've got to get help," the hunter
said. "You folks can't stay here all night, even
if the wind continues to blow across the top,
which makes it much better."</p>

<p>"Indeed and I will not stay here all night!"
protested Mr. Bunn. "I most strenuously object
to it."</p>

<p>"And so do I!" growled Mr. Sneed. "There
is no need of it. I might have known something<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
unpleasant would happen. I had a feeling in my
bones that it would."</p>

<p>"Well, you'll have a freezing feeling in your
bones if I don't get help," observed Mr. Macksey,
grimly.</p>

<p>"And I am hungry, too," went on Mr. Sneed.
"Why was not food brought with us in anticipation
of this emergency?"</p>

<p>"Haf a pretzel!" offered Mr. Switzer, holding
one out.</p>

<p>"Away with the vile thing!" snapped Mr.
Sneed.</p>

<p>Mr. Macksey was about to leap on the back
of the horse and start off, when the same driver
who had noticed the change in the wind called
out:</p>

<p>"I say, Mr. Macksey, I have a plan."</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>"Maybe you won't have to go for help, after
all. Why can't we take the forward bob from
under the rear sled and put it in place of the broken
one on the first sled? We can easily pass the
bob by the second sled even if the place is
narrow."</p>

<p>"By hickory! Why didn't you think of that
before?" demanded the hunter. "Of course we
can do it! Lively now, and we'll make the
change. Got to be quick, or it'll be pitch dark."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>It would have been very dark long ago had it
not been for the snow, which gave a sort of reflected
light.</p>

<p>"Come on!" cried Mr. Macksey. "We'll
make the change. I guess I'll have to ask you
folks to get out again," he said to the players in
the first sled. "But it won't be for long. We'll
have a good runner in place of the broken one,
and then we can pile into two sleds and get into
Elk Lodge. We'll leave the last sled until to-morrow."</p>

<p>"But what about our baggage?" asked Miss
Pennington. "That is in the rear sled. Can we
take that with us?"</p>

<p>"Not all of it," answered the hunter, "but you
can crowd in as much as possible. The rest can
wait."</p>

<p>"I want <i>all</i> of mine," declared the former
vaudeville actress.</p>

<p>"So do I!" cried Miss Dixon.</p>

<p>"You'll be lucky if you get in out of this
storm," said Mr. Pertell reprovingly, "to say
nothing about baggage. Do the best you can, Mr.
Macksey."</p>

<p>"I will. Come now, men, lively!"</p>

<p>It took some little time to make the change, but
finally the work was done.</p>

<p>The broken runner was cast aside, and there<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
were now two good sleds, one ahead of the other
in the snowy defile. As much of the needed baggage
as possible was transferred, and the four
horses that had been on the rear sled were brought
up and hitched to the remaining sleds&mdash;two to
each so that each conveyance now had six animals
attached to it.</p>

<p>"And by hickory!" exclaimed Mr. Macksey,
that appearing to be his favorite expression, "By
hickory, we'll need 'em all!"</p>

<p>They were now ready to set forth, and all rather
dreaded going out into the open again, for the
defile offered a good shelter from the storm. But
it had to be done, for it was out of the question
to stay there all night.</p>

<p>"Go 'long!" called the hunter, as he shook the
long reins of his six horses, and cracked the whip
with a report like a pistol. But the lash did not
fall on the backs of the ready animals. Mr. Macksey
never beat his horses&mdash;they were willing
enough without that.</p>

<p>Lanterns had been lighted and hung on the
sleds, to shed their warning rays through the
storm. They now gleamed fitfully through the
fast-falling snow.</p>

<p>"Are you feeling better now, Daddy?" asked
Ruth of her father, as she glanced anxiously at
him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>"Much better, yes. I am afraid I ought to give
you back your muffler, Paul," he added.</p>

<p>"No indeed&mdash;please keep it," begged the young
actor.</p>

<p>Alice reached beneath the blanket and pressed
his hand in appreciation.</p>

<p>"Thanks," he laughed.</p>

<p>"It is I who thank you," she returned, softly.</p>

<p>They were now out in the open road, and the
fury of the blast struck them with all its cruel
force.</p>

<p>"Keep covered up!" shouted Mr. Macksey,
through the visor of his cap, which was pulled
down over his face. "We'll be there pretty
soon."</p>

<p>On through the drifts plunged the straining
horses. It was all six of them could do, pull as
they might, to make their way. How cruelly the
wind cut, and how the snow flakes stung! Soft
as they really were, the wind gave them the feeling
of pieces of sand and stone.</p>

<p>On through the storm went the delayed party.
And then, when each one, in spite of his or her
fortitude, was almost giving up in despair at the
cold and the anxiety Mr. Macksey shouted out;</p>

<p>"Whoa! Here we are! All out for Elk
Lodge!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<h3>THROUGH THE ICE</h3>


<p>Warming, comforting beams of light shone
from a large, low building set back from the road
in a little clearing of the woods. It was too dark
to see more than this&mdash;that the structure offered
shelter, warmth and light. Yes, and something
else, for there was borne on the wings of the wind
the most delicious odor&mdash;the odor of supper.</p>

<p>"Pile out, folks! Pile out!" cried the genial
old hunter. "Here we are! At Elk Lodge! No
more storm! No more cold! Get inside to the
blaze. I reckon mother's about given us up; but
we're here, and we won't do a thing to her cooking!
Pile out!"</p>

<p>It was an invitation that needed no repetition.
It was greeted with a merry shout, even Mr.
Sneed, the grouch, condescending to say:</p>

<p>"Ah, that sounds good!"</p>

<p>"Ha! Den if dere iss food to eat I dinks me
dot I don't need to eat my pretzels. I can safe<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
dem for annoder time!" cried Mr. Switzer, as
he got out.</p>

<p>There was a laugh at this, and it was added to
when Mr. Bunn called out in his deepest tragic
voice:</p>

<p>"Ha! Someone has my silk hat!"</p>

<p>For he had persisted in wearing that in the
storm, though it was most uncomfortable.</p>

<p>"It is gone!" he added. "Stolen, mayhap.
Has anyone seen it?"</p>

<p>"Probably blew off," said Russ. "We'll find
it&mdash;when the snow melts!"</p>

<p>Wellington Bunn groaned&mdash;again tragically.</p>

<p>"I'll get you another," offered Mr. Pertell, generously.</p>

<p>"Come on, folks! Pile out!" cried Mr. Macksey
again.</p>

<p>"I'm so stiff I can hardly move!" declared
Ruth.</p>

<p>"So am I," added Alice. "Oh, but it's good
to be here!"</p>

<p>"I thought you liked the storm so," observed
Ruth.</p>

<p>"I do, but I like supper too, and I think it must
be ready."</p>

<p>Out of the sleds climbed the cold and cramped
picture players, all thought of the fierce storm
now forgotten.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>"Go right in," invited Mr. Macksey. "Supper's
waiting!"</p>

<p>"Welcome to Elk Lodge!" called a motherly
voice, and Mrs. Macksey appeared in the open door
of the main corridor. "Come right in!"</p>

<p>They were glad enough to do it.</p>

<p>"I don't know any of you, except Russ and Mr.
Pertell," she said, for the manager and his helper
had paid a visit to the place sometime before to
make arrangements about using it.</p>

<p>"You'll soon know all of 'em," declared Mr.
Pertell with a laugh. "I'll introduce you," which
he quickly did.</p>

<p>"Now then, I expect you'll want to wash up,"
went on the hunter's wife. "I'll have the girl
show you to your different rooms, and then you
can come down to supper. It's been waiting.
What kept you? I'll have to ask you folks because
it's like pulling teeth to get any news out
of my husband. What happened?"</p>

<p>"A breakdown," explained Ruth, who took an
instant liking to motherly Mrs. Macksey. "Oh,
we had such a time!"</p>

<p>"Such a glorious time!" supplemented Alice.</p>

<p>"Here's a girl who evidently likes outdoors,"
laughed the hunter's wife.</p>

<p>"Indeed I do!" cried Alice.</p>

<p>There was some little confusion, getting the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
players to their rooms, because of the lateness of
the arrival, but finally each one was in his or her
appointed apartment, and trying to get settled.
The rooms were small but comfortable, and the
hunters who had built the lodge for themselves
had provided many comforts.</p>

<p>"There ought to be a private bath for each
one," declared Miss Pennington, as she surveyed
her room.</p>

<p>"Indeed there ought," agreed her friend Miss
Dixon. "I think this place is horrid!"</p>

<p>"How thoughtless and selfish they are," said
Ruth, who shared a room with Alice.</p>

<p>"Aren't they! I think it's lovely here. Oh,
but I am so hungry!"</p>

<p>"So am I, dear."</p>

<p>"Glad to hear it for once, Ruth. Usually you
have so little appetite that one would think you
were in love."</p>

<p>"Silly! I'm going to eat to-night anyhow."</p>

<p>"Does that mean you are <i>not</i> in love?"</p>

<p>"Silly!" cried Ruth again, but that was all she
answered.</p>

<p>What a glorious and home-like place Elk Lodge
was! Yes, even better than the best home the
moving picture girls had known most of their
lives, for they had spent part of the time boarding,
as their father traveled about with his theatrical<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
company, and who can compare a home to a boarding
house?</p>

<p>Down in the big living room a fire burned and
crackled, and gave out spicy odors on the great
hearth that took in logs six feet long. And how
cheerfully and ruddily the blaze shone out! It
mellowed and cheered everyone. Even Mr. Sneed
smiled, and stretched out his hands to the leaping
flames.</p>

<p>As Ruth and Alice were about to go down,
having called to their father across the hall that
they were ready for him, there came a knock on
their door.</p>

<p>"Come in!" invited Ruth.</p>

<p>"Sorry to trouble you," spoke Miss Pennington,
"but have you any cold cream and&mdash;er&mdash;powder?
Our things were left in the other sled&mdash;I
mean all of those things, and Laura and I
can't&mdash;we simply can't get along without
them."</p>

<p>"I have cold cream," said Alice. "But powder&mdash;that
is unless it's talcum or rice&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That will have to do I guess," sighed the
vaudeville actress. "But I did hope you had a
bit of rouge, I'm so pale!"</p>

<p>"Never use it!" said Alice quickly. Too
quickly, hospitable Ruth thought, for, though she
decried the use of "paint," she would not be rude<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
to a guest, and, under these circumstances Miss
Pennington was a guest.</p>

<p>"You don't need it," the caller said, with a
glance at Alice's glowing cheeks, to whom the
wind and snow had presented two damask spots
that were most becoming.</p>

<p>"The weather is very chapping to my face," the
former vaudeville actress went on. "I really
must have something," and she departed with the
cold cream and some harmless rice powder, which
Ruth and Alice used judiciously and sparingly,
and only when needed.</p>

<p>The fine supper, late as it was, necessarily,
was enjoyed to the utmost. It was bountiful and
good, and though at first Miss Pennington and
Miss Dixon were inclined to sniff at the lack of
"courses," and the absence of lobster, it was noticed
that they ate heartily.</p>

<p>"There is only one thing more I want," sighed
Paul, as he leaned back in his chair.</p>

<p>"What, pray? It seems to me, and I have been
watching you, that you have had about all that is
good for you," laughed Alice. "I have seen you
get three separate and distinct helpings of fried
chicken."</p>

<p>"Oh, I didn't mean anything more to eat," he
said, quickly, "and if you are going to watch me
so closely I shall have to cut down my rations, I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
fear. What I meant was that I would like a moving
picture of this supper. It has memories that
long will linger, but I fain would have a souvenir
of it."</p>

<p>"Be careful that you don't get indigestion as
a souvenir," laughed Alice, as he followed her
sister from the table.</p>

<p>The dining room opened off the great living
apartment with that wonderful fire, and following
the meal all the members of the company gathered
about the hearth.</p>

<p>Outside the storm still raged, and Mr. Macksey,
who came in from having with his men, put away
the horses, reported that the blizzard was growing
worse.</p>

<p>"It's a good thing we thought of changing the
bobs and coming on," he said. "Otherwise we
might be there yet."</p>

<p>"What really happened?" asked his wife. "I
was telling one of the young ladies that it was like
pulling teeth to get any news out of you."</p>

<p>"Oh, we just had a little breakdown," he said.
"Now, folks, just make yourselves at home. Go
to bed when you like, get up when you please.
I'll try and get the rest of your baggage here
some time to-morrow, if this storm lets up."</p>

<p>"I hope you do get it," complained Miss Pennington.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>"Selfish thing!" whispered Alice. "All she
wants is her paint!"</p>

<p>"Hush," cautioned Ruth. "She'll hear you!"</p>

<p>"I don't care," voiced her sister.</p>

<p>They talked of many things as they sat about
the fire, and then Mr. Pertell said:</p>

<p>"We will film no dramas while the storm continues,
but as soon as we can get out on the ice I
want to start one."</p>

<p>"Is there skating about here?" asked Alice,
who was very fond of the sport.</p>

<p>"There's a fine lake back of the lodge," replied
Mr. Macksey, "and as soon as the storm lets up
I'll have the men clear a place of snow, and you
can have all the fun you want."</p>

<p>"Oh, joy!" cried Alice.</p>

<p>"Save me the first skate," whispered Paul to
her, and she nodded acquiescence.</p>

<p>Mr. Pertell briefly outlined the drama he expected
to film on the ice, and then, after a little
more talk, every one voted that bed was the best
place in the world. For the wind had made them
all sleepy, and they were tired out from the storm
and their long journey.</p>

<p>Alice and Ruth went up to their room. Alice
pulled aside the curtain from the window and
looked out on a scene of swirling whiteness. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
flakes dashed against the pane as though knocking
for admission.</p>

<p>"It's a terrible night," said Ruth, with a little
shiver.</p>

<p>"Well, much as I like weather, I wouldn't want
to be out in it long," Alice confessed. "Elk
Lodge is a very good place in a blizzard."</p>

<p>"Suppose we got snowed in?" asked Ruth, apprehensively.</p>

<p>"Then we'll dig our way out&mdash;simple answer.
Oh dear!" and Alice yawned luxuriously, if not
politely, showing her pretty teeth.</p>

<p>In spite of the portentous nature of the storm,
it was not fully borne out, and morning saw the
sun shining on the piles of snow that had fallen.
There had been a considerable quantity sifted
down on what was already about Elk Lodge, but
there was not enough to hinder traffic for the
sturdy lumbermen and hunters of that region.</p>

<p>The wind had died down, and it was not cold,
so when Mr. Macksey announced that he was going
back after the broken-down sleigh, Ruth and
Alice asked permission to accompany him.</p>

<p>Before starting off Mr. Macksey had set a
gang of men, hired for the occasion, to scraping
the snow off the frozen lake, and when Ruth and
Alice came back they found several of the picture<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
players skating, while Russ was getting ready to
film one of the first scenes of the drama.</p>

<p>"You're in this, Mr. Sneed," said the manager.
"You are supposed to be skating along,
when you trip and fall breaking your leg&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hold on&mdash;stop&mdash;break my leg! Never!"
cried the grouchy actor.</p>

<p>"Of course you don't really injure yourself!"
exclaimed the manager, testily.</p>

<p>"Oh, why did I ever come to this miserable
place!" sighed Mr. Sneed. "I despise cold
weather!"</p>

<p>But there was no help for it. Soon he was
on the steel runners gliding about, while Russ
filmed him. Mr. Sneed was a good skater, and
was not averse to "showing off."</p>

<p>"All ready, now!" called the manager to him.
"Get that fall in right there. Russ, be ready
for him!"</p>

<p>"Oh!" groaned the actor. "Here I go!"</p>

<p>And, as luck would have it, he, at that moment,
tripped on a stick, and fell in earnest. It was
much better done than if he had simulated it.</p>

<p>But something else happened. He fell so
heavily, and at a spot where there was a treacherous
air hole, that, the next instant Mr. Sneed
broke through the ice, and was floundering in
the chilly water.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<h3>THE CURIOUS DEER</h3>


<p>"Quick! A rope!"</p>

<p>"No, boards are better!"</p>

<p>"Fence rails will do!"</p>

<p>"Oh, get him out, someone!"</p>

<p>These were only some of the cries uttered,
following the accident to Mr. Sneed. Meanwhile
he was doing his best to keep himself above
water by grasping the edge of the ice.</p>

<p>But it crumbled in his fingers, and he was so
shocked by the sudden immersion, and by the
cold, and his skates were so heavy on his feet,
that he went down again and again. Fortunately
the lake was not deep at that point, and as he
went down his feet would touch bottom, and he
could spring up again.</p>

<p>"Don't go out there!" warned Mr. Pertell, as
Paul started for the spot.</p>

<p>"Why not?" asked the young actor.</p>

<p>"Because the ice is probably thin all around<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
that place. I don't want two of you in. Hold on,
Mr. Sneed!" he cried to the desperate actor.
"We'll have you out in no time!"</p>

<p>"Shall I get this?" cried Russ, who had not
deserted his camera, even as a gunner will not
leave his cannon, nor a captain his ship. More
than once brave moving picture operators have
stood in the face of danger to get rare views.</p>

<p>"Yes, get every motion of it!" cried the manager.</p>

<p>"But it isn't in the play!"</p>

<p>"I don't care! We'll write it in afterward.
You get the pictures and we'll rescue Mr. Sneed.
Hi, there, Mr. Bunn, you must help with this. Get
some fence rails! We can slide them out on the
ice and they will distribute the weight so that the
ice will hold us."</p>

<p>"But where will I get fence rails?" asked the
actor.</p>

<p>"Oh, gnaw them out of a tree!" cried Mr. Pertell,
who was much disturbed and nervous.
"Don't you see that fence?" he cried, pointing to
one not far off. "Get some rails from that. And
then get in the picture!"</p>

<p>"Oh, such a life!" groaned Mr. Bunn.</p>

<p>"This is to save a life!" the manager reminded
him.</p>

<p>And while Russ continued to make moving pic<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>tures
of the unexpected scene, the others set about
the work of rescue. Later this could be interpolated
in the drama to make it appear as though
it had all been arranged in advance.</p>

<p>"Hurry with those rails!" called Mr. Pertell
to Mr. Bunn. "He can't stay in that icy water
forever."</p>

<p>Some of the men who had been working at removing
the snow now came up with ropes and
trace chains. Then, when the rails were spread
out on the ice, near the air hole, the rescuers were
able to get near enough to throw the ends of
several lines to Mr. Sneed. He managed to grasp
one, and, a moment later was hauled out on the
ice.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I&mdash;I'm c-c-c-cold!" he stammered, as he
stood with the icy water dripping from him.</p>

<p>"Shouldn't wonder but what you were," agreed
Mr. Pertell. "Now the thing for you to do is to
run to the Lodge as fast as you can. Here, Mr.
Bunn, you and Paul run alongside him, with a
hold on either arm. We'll call this film 'A Modern
Pickwick,' instead of what we planned. In
<ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Dicken's'">Dickens'</ins> story there's a scene somewhat like this.
We'll change the whole thing about.</p>

<p>"Russ, you go on ahead, and when Paul and
Mr. Bunn come along with Mr. Sneed, you get
them as they run."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>"All right," assented the young moving picture
operator, as he kept on grinding away at the crank.</p>

<p>Exercise was the best thing to restore the circulation
of the actor who had fallen into the water,
and he soon had plenty of it. With Paul on one
side, and Mr. Bunn on the other, he was raced
back to Elk Lodge, and there he was supplied
plentifully with hot lemonade to ward off a cold.
Russ got interior pictures of these scenes as well,
and later the film made a great success.</p>

<p>"In view of the accident, and the fact that
you are all more or less upset," said Mr. Pertell,
when some of the excitement had calmed down,
"we will give up work for the rest of the day.
You may do as you please until to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Then I'm going for a walk," cried Alice.</p>

<p>"I'm with you," spoke Paul, "only we ought
to have snowshoes."</p>

<p>"Oh, could we get any?" she cried.</p>

<p>"I can arrange for some for you," promised
Mr. Macksey, "but I haven't any now."</p>

<p>"Good idea!" exclaimed the manager. "An
idea for a new film&mdash;'The Snowshoe Rescue!'
Here, Russ, make some notes of this for future
use," and he began to dictate to the young operator,
who with his employer frequently thus improvised
dramas out of a mere suggestion.</p>

<p>"If you want to walk," said Mr. Macksey to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
Alice, "you'd better stick to the road. The men
have been out with homemade snowplows breaking
a trail. That's what we do around here after
a storm. You'd better stick to the road."</p>

<p>"We will!" cried Alice. "Will you come,
Ruth?"</p>

<p>"Later perhaps&mdash;not now. I want to study a
new part I have."</p>

<p>"I suppose you're waiting for Russ," whispered
Alice.</p>

<p>"Don't be silly!" flashed Ruth. But she did
not go out with her sister.</p>

<p>Alice and Paul had a glorious walk in the snow,
and saw a beautiful country, even though it was
hidden under a mantle of white. For Deerfield
was a lovely place.</p>

<p>"Aren't you cold?" asked Ruth, when her sister
returned.</p>

<p>"Not a bit. It's glorious. What did you do,
and how is Mr. Sneed?"</p>

<p>"He's doing nicely, I believe. As for me, I
stayed in. I had some mending to do."</p>

<p>"Is that why Russ has threads on his coat
sleeve&mdash;was it his coat <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'your'">you</ins> were mending?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Alice&mdash;you are hopeless!" protested
Ruth, but she blushed vividly.</p>

<p>That afternoon, as Mrs. Macksey was overseeing
the getting of supper, Alice, who went to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
the kitchen for something, heard the veteran
hunter and his wife in conversation.</p>

<p>"You say they are strangers about here?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, three men. I saw them after you had
gone to the station to get the moving picture
folks. There were three men, and I think they
were after deer."</p>

<p>"After deer, eh? Don't they know that this is
a private preserve?"</p>

<p>"They didn't seem to care. They came to ask
their direction. They all had guns, and I'm sure
they were after deer."</p>

<p>"And you never saw them before?"</p>

<p>"No, I never did."</p>

<p>"And you have no idea where they came
from?"</p>

<p>"I couldn't tell&mdash;no. I heard one of them ask
the other if he thought it was safe."</p>

<p>"If what was safe?"</p>

<p>"He didn't say. Maybe he meant to hunt deer
around here."</p>

<p>"It won't be safe if I catch them!" declared
Mr. Macksey, as he went out. Alice wondered
who the men could be.</p>

<p>It was so quiet and peaceful at Elk Lodge that
Mr. DeVere soon forgot all about the annoyance
caused by the demand of Dan Merley for the five<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
hundred dollars. At first he had expected some
sort of legal summons in a suit, but when none
came he breathed easier.</p>

<p>Several days passed, and a few snow scenes
were filmed to be used later, and worked into
dramas. Mr. Sneed suffered a little cold from
his unexpected bath, but that was all.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the weather had remained about the
same. There was plenty of snow, but no more
storms. Elk Lodge was voted the finest place in
the world, and even Miss Pennington and Miss
Dixon condescended to say that they liked it.</p>

<p>Then, one day, plans were made for filming a
little drama in the snowy woods, and thither many
members of the company went to act.</p>

<p>Ruth was supposed to be lost in a dense thicket,
and Paul was soon on his way to find her, in the
guise of a woodman. He had sighted Ruth, over
a clump of bushes, and was making his way
to her, when he heard her scream. This was not
in the play and he wondered what could <ins title="Transcriber's Note: this word inserted into text">have</ins> happened.</p>

<p>"Quick!" he heard her cry. "He's going to
jump at me!"</p>

<p>Paul broke into a run, and the next moment
saw a deer, with large, branching antlers, spring
through the underbrush directly in front of Ruth,
while Russ, at the camera, yelled to drive away the
curious animal.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<h3>THE COASTING RACE</h3>


<p>"Oh, I'm so frightened!" cried Ruth.</p>

<p>"Don't be alarmed!" Russ called to her, while
he continued to grind away at the camera. "He
won't hurt you. This will make a dandy picture!
I'm going to film the deer."</p>

<p>"Oh, but suppose he jabs me with his horns?"
wailed Ruth, who was not quite so alarmed now.
"They are terribly sharp."</p>

<p>"Don't worry!" Russ answered. "This is
coming out great. The deer was just the one thing
needed to make this film a success."</p>

<p>"Then I won't spoil it by coming in now!"
called Paul, who was keeping out of the focus
of the camera by crouching down behind some
bushes. He had heard what Russ said, and
had given up his plan of rushing to rescue Ruth.
Evidently there was no need.</p>

<p>The deer, strange to say, did not seem at all
alarmed, and stood gazing at Ruth with great<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
brown eyes. She too, realizing that she was not
to be harmed, acted more naturally now, and with
an appreciation of what was needed to make the
film a proper one.</p>

<p>She first "registered" fear, and then delighted
surprise, at seeing the animal.</p>

<p>I might explain that in making moving pictures
certain directions are given to the actors. As
they can not depend on speaking words to let the
audiences know what is going on, they must intimate,
by appropriate gesture, or facial expression,
the action of the play. This is called "registering,"
and when in the directions, or scenario, an
actor or actress is told to "register" fear, surprise,
anger, love, jealousy&mdash;in fact any of the
emotions&mdash;he or she knows what is meant.</p>

<p>In this case Ruth was without specific directions
save those called out by Russ. And often, in an
emergency a good moving picture camera operator
can save a film from being spoiled by improvising
some "stage directions," if I may call them
such.</p>

<p>"Shall I approach him, Russ?" Ruth asked,
as she saw that the deer showed no intentions of
fleeing.</p>

<p>"Yes, if he'll let you. It will make a dandy
scene."</p>

<p>"Not too close," cautioned Paul, who was still<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
out of sight behind the bushes, waiting until he
could properly come into the scene. "He might
<ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'accidently'">accidentally</ins> hit you with a sweep of his horns."</p>

<p>"I'll be careful," answered Ruth. "I believe
the poor thing is hungry."</p>

<p>"If we only had something to feed him!" exclaimed
Russ. "That would work in fine."</p>

<p>"I have some lumps of sugar," said Ruth,
speaking with her head turned aside. The reason
for this was that she did not want the movement
of her lips to show on the film, and the camera
will catch and fix even that slight motion.</p>

<p>The reason Ruth spoke aside was because the
little scene was being improvised, and she had no
proper lines to speak. And, as I have already explained,
often persons in the audience of a moving
picture theatre are able to understand what is
said, merely by watching the lips of the performers
on the screen.</p>

<p>"Sugar! Good!" cried Russ. "See if he'll
take it. I don't know what deer like best, but if
they're anything like horses they'll revel in sugar.
Go ahead!"</p>

<p>Ruth had in her pocket some lumps she had
intended giving to the horses attached to the sleds
in which they had come to the woods. She now
took out some of these and held them out to the
timid deer.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>The beautiful creature, made bold, perhaps, by
hunger, came a step nearer.</p>

<p>"Oh, that's fine!" cried Russ, squinting
through the focusing tube to get clear, sharp
impressions on the film. "Keep at it, Ruth."</p>

<p>The deer came nearer, thrusting forth its velvet
nose. It sniffed at the sugar Ruth held, and
then put out its lips and tongue and picked up
the lumps.</p>

<p>"Fine!" cried Russ. "Maybe he'd like salt
better, for I've read of salt-licks that animals
visit, but sugar will do on a pinch; won't it, old
fellow?"</p>

<p>Perhaps it was the loud, laughing voice that
Russ used, or it may have been because there
was no more sugar, but, at any rate, the deer,
after taking the sweet lumps gave a sudden turn,
and rushed off through the bushes, going rather
slowly because of the deep snow.</p>

<p>Russ caught every motion of the graceful
creature, however, and called out to Ruth to
pose with her hand shaded over her eyes, as
though she were looking after the deer. She did
this, and that ended the little scene with the timid
woodland creature, who, if he ever saw moving
pictures, would doubtless be very much surprised
to perceive a presentment of himself on the
screen.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>"Come on now, Paul!" called Russ, indicating
to the young actor to show himself so that
he would get into the picture.</p>

<p>The other players who had come up on hearing
Ruth call out were now ready for their parts
in the play. They had kept out of sight of the
camera, however, so as not to spoil the picture.</p>

<p>"Very well done!" declared Mr. Pertell,
when Ruth had finished her part in the play.
"That deer will make a very effective picture,
I think."</p>

<p>"It was a dear deer!" punned Alice, and the
others laughed.</p>

<p>On the way back to Elk Lodge the manager
made an announcement that interested all in the
company, the young people especially.</p>

<p>"I have a drama," he said, "that calls for a
coasting race in one scene. I wonder if we
couldn't do that to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Oh, riding down hill!" cried Alice, with
girlish enthusiasm. "What fun! May I steer
a bob?"</p>

<p>"Alice, you never could!" cried Ruth.</p>

<p>"Pooh! I've done it lots of times!" her sister
answered.</p>

<p>"Yes, when you were a little girl, perhaps,
with two sleds held together," laughed Mr. Pertell.
"This will be different. Mr. Macksey tells<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
me he has two big, old-fashioned bobsleds in one
of the barns. Now I think we can get up two
parties and have a big coasting race. The play
calls for it, and the young men who steer the
bobs are rivals for the hand of the same girl.
She has made a condition that whoever gets
first to the bottom of the big hill may marry
her. So you see the plan of the play."</p>

<p>"Me for a bob!" cried Paul.</p>

<p>"I wish I didn't have to film the play&mdash;I'd
steer one, too!" exclaimed Russ, with a look at
Ruth that made her blush.</p>

<p>"Must I get into this silly coasting play?"
asked Mr. Bunn.</p>

<p>"You surely must," answered Mr. Pertell.
"And I want to warn you of one thing&mdash;you
are not to wear a high hat&mdash;it would only blow
off and embarrass you."</p>

<p>"Not wear my high hat? Then I refuse to
take part!" cried the tragic actor.</p>

<p>But Mr. Pertell paid no attention to him, for
he had heard the same thing before.</p>

<p>The details of the coasting race were discussed
on the way to Elk Lodge, and it was arranged
that a partial rehearsal should be held
next day.</p>

<p>That night, as Alice and Ruth were going to
bed rather early, on account of the wearying<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
work of the day, they heard voices out in the
hall near their room.</p>

<p>"Listen!" warned Alice, raising her finger,
for Ruth was talking.</p>

<p>"It's Mr. and Mrs. Macksey," said Ruth.</p>

<p>"I know. But what are they saying? It's
something about those strange hunters who were
seen about here once before."</p>

<p>Mr. Macksey, who had been summoned to the
upper hall by his wife to fix a broken window,
was speaking in his deep voice.</p>

<p>"So those fellows were around again; eh?"
he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, and I don't like it, Jake," Mrs. Macksey
replied. "You know what it means if they
kill any of the club deer. It may cost you your
place here. The members of the club may say
you were not careful enough."</p>

<p>"That's so, wife. I reckon I'd better look
after those chaps. If they're trespassing on Elk
Lodge I can have them arrested anyhow."</p>

<p>The next day was clear and calm, just right
for taking pictures, and after breakfast the entire
company went out on the hill where the bobsled
race was to take place.</p>

<p>The hill had been prepared in advance by men
from Elk Lodge, so that the sleds would attain
good speed. The snow had been packed down,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
and a place made for Russ to set up his camera.</p>

<p>"Paul, you will steer one bob," said Mr. Pertell,
as he was arranging the affair, "and Mr.
Sneed will take the other."</p>

<p>"What, me steer a bobsled down that hill?"
cried the grouchy actor, as he looked at the steep
slope.</p>

<p>"Of course," said the manager.</p>

<p>"Something is sure to happen," declared Mr.
Sneed.</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" exclaimed Mr. Pertell. "All
you have to do is to keep the wheel steady."</p>

<p>The company of players, with a number of
men from Elk Lodge, added to fill the bobs,
now divided themselves into two parties. Ruth
was to go on the sled with Mr. Sneed, and sit
directly behind him so as to show well in the
camera. Alice was to ride next to Paul on the
other sled. The bobs were long ones, with bells
and large steering wheels in front.</p>

<p>"All ready?" called Mr. Pertell, when the
players were seated.</p>

<p>"All ready!" cried Russ, indicating that the
camera was prepared.</p>

<p>"Go!" ordered the manager, and the men
detailed to push the bobs shoved them ahead.
The moving picture coasting race was on.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<h3>ON SNOWSHOES</h3>


<p>"Here we go!"</p>

<p>"Hold on tight, everybody!"</p>

<p>"Let's see if we can't win!"</p>

<p>With shouts and laughter the merry coasters
thus enlivened the race down hill. In order to
make the moving pictures appear as realistic as
possible Mr. Pertell had told the players to forget,
for the time being, that they were actors,
and to imagine that they were just boys and
girls, out for a real frolic.</p>

<p>"And I'm sure I feel like one!" cried Alice,
as she clung to the sides of the bob, where she
sat behind Paul.</p>

<p>"That's the way to talk!" he laughed. "Look
out for yourself now, we're going to bump!"</p>

<p>At that moment they came to a "thank-ye-ma'am,"
as they are called in the country.</p>

<p>This is a ridge, or bump in the road, made
to keep the rain water from rushing down the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
highway too fast. The ridge turns the water to
one side.</p>

<p>As Paul spoke the sled reached this place, rose
into the air, and came down heavily.</p>

<p>"Gracious!" cried Alice. "I was nearly
bounced off!"</p>

<p>"I warned you!" laughed Paul. "There's
another one just below. Watch out for it."</p>

<p>Paul's sled was a little ahead of the one
steered by Mr. Sneed, and the latter was unaware
of the treacherous nature of the road. So
he did not warn his fellow coasters. The result
was that two of those on the rear fell off,
but as they landed in soft snow they were not
hurt.</p>

<p>"All the better!" cried Russ, who was making
the pictures. "That will add to it. Keep going,
Mr. Sneed!"</p>

<p>"If I go much farther I'll fall off!" cried
the grouchy actor. "I can't hold on much
longer!"</p>

<p>"You've got to!" ordered Mr. Pertell. "I'm
not going to have this picture spoiled."</p>

<p>"Please don't fall off, whatever you do!"
cried Ruth, who was back of Mr. Sneed. "That
would leave me to do the steering and I don't
know the first thing about it."</p>

<p>"Well, I'll do my best," he said, as graciously<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
as he could. "Certainly I don't want to make
trouble for you, Miss DeVere."</p>

<p>"Thank you," she said, and then as she
looked ahead and saw another bump in the road,
she cried:</p>

<p>"Look out! We're going to hit it."</p>

<p>Now Mr. Sneed was still suffering from the
effects of the first bump, and not wishing to repeat
it he sought to avoid the second by steering
to one side. But in steering a long and heavy
bobsled, well-laden with coasters, there is one
thing to be remembered. That is, it must not
be steered too suddenly to one side, for it has
a propensity to "skid" worse than an automobile.</p>

<p>This was what happened in the case of Mr.
Sneed. He turned the steering wheel suddenly,
the bobsled slewed to one side, and, in another
instant, had upset.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear!"</p>

<p>"We'll be killed!"</p>

<p>These two expressions came respectively from
Miss Pennington and Miss Dixon. Some of the
men cried out and a number of the girls
screamed; but, after all, no one was hurt, for
the snow was soft and luckily the bob rolled to
one side, not hitting anyone.</p>

<p>The moment he realized that it was about to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
capsize Mr. Sneed let go of the steering wheel,
and gave a jump which carried him out of harm's
way, so the only mishap he suffered was a rather
severe shaking up, and being covered with
snow. Considerable of the white stuff got in
his mouth.</p>

<p>"Wuff!" he spluttered. "I&mdash;gurr&mdash;will
never&mdash;burr&mdash;steer&mdash;another&mdash;whew&mdash;sled!"</p>

<p>By this time he had cleared his mouth of snow,
and repeated his determination, without the interruptions
and stutterings.</p>

<p>"Did you get that spill, Russ?" asked Mr.
Pertell, who could not keep from laughing.</p>

<p>"Every move of it; yes, sir!"</p>

<p>"Good. I think we can make use of it,
though it wasn't in the scenario. But we'll have
to start over again. I want to get a good close
finish."</p>

<p>"What's that you said?" asked Mr. Sneed,
as he dusted the snow from his clothes, and
looked at the overturned bob.</p>

<p>"I said," repeated the manager, "that we'd
have to do the coasting scene over again, as I
wanted to show a close finish of the two sleds
at the foot of the hill, and now we can't, for
one is down there, and the other is up here."</p>

<p>This was true enough, since Paul had steered
his sled properly, and had reached the foot of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
the slope, where he and the others waved to
their less fortunate competitors.</p>

<p>"Well, you can have the race over again if
you like," said Mr. Sneed, with decision, "but
I am not going to steer. I knew something
would happen if I steered a bob."</p>

<p>"Well, you were right&mdash;for once," conceded
Mr. Pertell, with a smile. "And perhaps you
are right not to want to steer again. It may
not be safe."</p>

<p>"I'll do it!" offered Mr. Switzer. "In der
old country yet I haf steered sleds bigger yet
as dis von."</p>

<p>"All right, you may try," said Mr. Pertell.
"Now then, is anyone hurt?"</p>

<p>"I am not, I'm glad to say," laughed Ruth,
who was brushing the snow from her garments.
"But it was a narrow escape."</p>

<p>"Indeed it was!" snapped Miss Dixon. "It
was all your fault, too, Mr. Sneed!"</p>

<p>"My fault, how?"</p>

<p>"You steered to one side too quickly. Don't
you try that, Mr. Switzer."</p>

<p>"Indeed und I vill not. You can trust me!"</p>

<p>"Get ready then," ordered Mr. Pertell.
"Come on back!" he called to Paul and his companions
at the foot of the hill.</p>

<p>As the story in which the coasting race figured<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
would have to be changed to make the accident
fit in, Mr. Pertell had Russ get all the incidental
scenes he could, showing the overturned bob
being righted, the coasters getting ready for
the new race, and the other bob being pulled up
hill.</p>

<p>Once more the rival coasters prepared to start
off, with Mr. Switzer replacing Mr. Sneed. This
time there was no upset, and the two sleds went
down close together.</p>

<p>Then something new developed. Mr. Switzer
spoke truly when he said he had been used to
steering bobs in Germany. He knew just how
to do it to get the best results, and take advantage
of every favorable spot on the hill.</p>

<p>Paul, too, seeing that it was to be a real race,
as well as one for the benefit of the moving
picture audiences, exerted himself to get the best
out of his sled. There is little a steersman on
a bob can do except to take advantage of the
easiest course. And this Paul did.</p>

<p>On and on went the big bobs, nearing the foot
of the hill.</p>

<p>"This is great!" cried Mr. Pertell.</p>

<p>"This will be some picture!" declared Russ,
with enthusiasm. "Come on, Paul, he's going
to win!"</p>

<p>"Not if I know it!" avowed the young actor.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, don't let them get ahead of us!" cried
Alice in Paul's ear.</p>

<p>"I'll do my best," he said, with a grim tightening
of his lips.</p>

<p>But it was not to be. Either a little more
skillful steering on the part of Mr. Switzer, or
a more favorable course enabled his sled to
shoot ahead, just at the finish, and he won the
race.</p>

<p>And then a curious thing happened. The sled
kept on going, and slid into a little clump of
bushes, from which, a moment later, a man with
a gun sprang.</p>

<p>This man seemed as surprised at being thus
driven from his shelter as were the coasters at
seeing him.</p>

<p>"Ha! Vot does dis mean?" demanded Mr.
Switzer. "Vos you vaiting for us mit dot
gun?"</p>

<p>Really the man did look a little menacing as
he stood there with poised weapon, looking at
the coasters.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon," he managed to stammer,
at length. "I did not see you coming."</p>

<p>"I guess it's our part to beg your pardon,"
said Mr. Sneed, who, though he did not steer
the bob, had been obliged to ride on it. "We
did not mean to run into you."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p>"No harm done; none at all," the man said.
"I was hiding here, waiting for a chance to
shoot at a fox that has a particularly fine pelt,
but I guess I may as well give up. I heard the
shouts of you folks, but I had no idea you would
coast away down here."</p>

<p>"I didn't haf no idea like dot myself," confessed
Mr. Switzer. "But if dere iss no hart
feelings ve vill let comeons be bygones."</p>

<p>"That suits me," laughed the stranger, as he
turned aside.</p>

<p>And, as he went away Ruth had a queer feeling
that she had seen him before and under odd
circumstances.</p>

<p>The coasting incident was over, the race had
been successfully filmed, and the coasters were
turning back up the hill, while Russ was demounting
his camera, for there would be no
more scenes taken at present.</p>

<p>"Did you notice that man, Alice?" asked
Ruth, as she went up the hill beside her sister.</p>

<p>"You mean the hunter who looked as though
he wanted to shoot some of us?"</p>

<p>"Oh, what a way to talk! But that's the one
I had reference to. Did you notice him particularly?"</p>

<p>"Not very. Why?"</p>

<p>"Do you think you ever saw him before?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<p>Ruth put the question in such a peculiar way
that Alice looked at her sharply.</p>

<p>"You don't mean he was one of the men who
tried to get Russ's patent; do you?"</p>

<p>"No. I can't, for the life of me, though,
think where I have seen that man before, but
I'm sure I have. I thought you might remember."</p>

<p>Alice tried to recall the face, but could not.</p>

<p>"I don't believe I ever saw him before," she
said, shaking her head. "He might be one of
the many actors we have met on our travels, or
in going around with daddy."</p>

<p>"No, I'm sure he never was an actor," spoke
Ruth. "Never mind, perhaps it will come to me
later."</p>

<p>And all the remainder of the day she tried
in vain to recall where she had seen that face
before.</p>

<p>Mr. Macksey seemed a trifle disturbed when
told of the man being on the hill with a gun.</p>

<p>"One of those pesky hunters!" he exclaimed.
"I've got notices posted all over the property
of Elk Lodge, but they don't seem to do any
good. I guess I'll have to get after those fellows
and give 'em a piece of my mind. I'd like to
find out where they are stopping."</p>

<p>The next few days were busy ones for the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
picture actors, and a number of dramas were
filmed. In one, two snow forts were built, and
the company indulged in a snowball battle before
the camera.</p>

<p>"And now for something new," said Mr. Pertell
one day, as he called the company together
in the big living room of the lodge, and pointed
to something piled in one corner. "You'll have
to have a few days' practice, I think, so I give
you fair notice."</p>

<p>"More coasting?" asked Mr. Sneed, suspiciously.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;snowshoes, this time," replied the
manager. "I am going to have you all travel
on them in one scene, and as they are rather
awkward you had better take a few lessons."</p>

<p>"Lessons on snowshoes!" cried Ruth. "Who
can give them to us?"</p>

<p>"I have a teacher," said the manager. "Russ,
tell Billy Jack to come in," and there entered
from the porch a tall Indian, dressed in modern
garb.</p>

<p>Miss Pennington screamed, as did Miss Dixon,
but the Indian smiled, showing some very fine
and white teeth, and said in a gentle voice:</p>

<p>"Don't be alarmed, ladies, I have no scalping
knife with me, and I assure you that you will
soon be able to get about on snowshoes."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>

<h3>A TIMELY SHOT</h3>


<p>Surprise, for the moment, made every member
of the moving picture company silent. That
an Indian should speak so correctly was a matter
of amazement. Mr. Pertell smiled quizzically
as he remarked.</p>

<p>"Billy Jack is one of the last of his tribe.
He is a full-blooded Indian, but he has been to
Carlisle, which may account for some things."</p>

<p>"I should say it would," murmured Paul Ardite.
"I'm glad I didn't give a war whoop!"</p>

<p>"I learned to use snowshoes when I was a
boy," went on the Indian, who, though roughly
dressed was cultured. "I have kept it up ever
since," he went on. "I have charge of a gang
of men getting out some lumber, not far from
here, and when Mr. Macksey told me there was
a company of moving picture actors and actresses
at Elk Lodge I spoke of the snowshoes."</p>

<p>"And when Mr. Macksey told me of it," put<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
in the manager, "I saw at once that we could
use a scene with some of you folks on the shoes.
So I arranged with Billy Jack."</p>

<p>"Is that your real name?" asked Alice, who
had taken a sudden liking to the rugged son of
the forest.</p>

<p>"That's one of my real names, strange as it
sounds," he answered. "I don't much fancy it;
but what am I to do?"</p>

<p>"I like it!" the girl announced, promptly.
"It's better than being Running Bear or something
like that."</p>

<p>"I had one of those names&mdash;in fact, I have it
yet," he said, "but I never use it. Flaming
Arrow is my real Indian name."</p>

<p>"Flaming Arrow! How romantic!" exclaimed
Miss Dixon. "How did you come to
get that?"</p>

<p>"Oh, when I was a boy an Indian from a
neighboring tribe shot an arrow, with some
burning tow on it, over into our camp, just in
a spirit of mischief, for we were friendly. I
snatched the arrow out of a pile of dry bark that
it might have set on fire, and so I got my name.
I am a Western Indian," Billy Jack explained,
"but of late I have made my home in New England.
Now, if you like, I will show you how to
use snowshoes."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>A number of the queer "tennis racquets," as
Alice called them, had been obtained through the
good offices of Billy Jack, he having arranged
for them in the lumber camp. Snowshoes, as
you all know, consist of a thin strip of wood,
bent around in a curve, and shaped not unlike
a lawn tennis racquet, except that the handle or
heel part is shorter. The shoes are laced with
thongs, and the feet are placed in the centre of
the criss-crossed thongs, and held there by other
thongs or straps.</p>

<p>The idea of snowshoes is to enable travelers
to make their way over deep drifts without sinking,
the shoes distributing the weight over a
larger area. They are not easy to use, and the
novice is very apt to trip by putting one shoe
down on top of the other, and then trying to step
out.</p>

<p>Billy Jack, or Flaming Arrow, as Ruth and
Alice voted to call him, first showed the members
of the company how to fasten the snowshoes on
their feet, allowing for the play of the heel. He
put a pair on himself, first, and stepped out over
a stretch of unbroken snow. Instead of sinking
down, as he would have done under ordinary
circumstances, he slipped over the surface as
lightly as a feather.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p>"Now, you try," he told Mr. Sneed, who was
near him.</p>

<p>"Who, me? Oh, I can't walk on these
things," protested the grouchy actor.</p>

<p>"Try!" ordered Mr. Pertell. "I have a very
important part for you in the new play."</p>

<p>"All right, if you say so, I suppose I must.
But I know something will happen," he sighed.</p>

<p>It did, and within a few seconds after Mr.
Sneed started out. He took three steps, and then,
forgetting that the snowshoes were rather large,
he tried to walk as though he did not have them
on. The result was he tripped, and came down
head first in a deep drift, and there he remained,
buried to his shoulders while his feet were up
in the air, wildly kicking about.</p>

<p>He was probably saying things, but they could
not be heard, for his head was under the snow.</p>

<p>"Somebody help him out!" cried Mr. Pertell,
trying to keep from laughing too hard.</p>

<p>In fact everyone was so amused that, for the
moment, no one rendered any aid to Mr. Sneed.
But Flaming Arrow finally went over to him,
and succeeded in righting him.</p>

<p>"Take&mdash;take 'em off!" spluttered the actor,
when he could speak. "I am through with snowshoes."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>He tried to unlace the thongs that bound his
feet, but could not manage it.</p>

<p>"Better try once more," advised Mr. Pertell.
"I really need you in the scene, Mr. Sneed, and
you will soon learn to get along on the snowshoes."</p>

<p>"I never will!" cried the grouch. "Take 'em
off, I say!"</p>

<p>But no one would, and finally, after Flaming
Arrow had given a few more demonstrations,
Mr. Sneed consented to try again. This time he
did a little better, but every once in a while he
would trip. He did not again dive into a snow
bank, however.</p>

<p>Other members of the company had haps and
mishaps, and Mr. Bunn stumbled about so that
he lost his new tall hat in a drift, and he refused
to go on with the act until the silk tile was dug
out.</p>

<p>But finally after two day's practice, the Indian
declared that the company was sufficiently expert
to allow the taking of pictures, and Russ
began to work the camera.</p>

<p>"Could we come over to your lumber camp
some day?" asked Alice of Flaming Arrow,
when the little drama was over.</p>

<p>"I would be pleased to have you," he replied,
with a smile. "There are a rough lot of men<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
there, but they are always glad to see visitors&mdash;especially
ladies. It is rather dull and lonesome
in the backwoods. This has been quite a little
vacation for me."</p>

<p>"Then we'll come and see you; won't we
Ruth?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, dear. We'll have to ask
daddy," responded Ruth, rather doubtfully.</p>

<p>"Oh, he'll say yes!" Alice cried. "He likes
us to see new sights, and I've never been in a
lumber camp yet."</p>

<p>"Bring your father along," invited Flaming
Arrow. "I think he would be interested."</p>

<p>Alice promised and then the Indian took his
leave. He promised to come another day and
bring a pair of skis, those long barrel-stave-like
affairs, on which experts can slide down a steep
hill, and make the most astonishing jumps.</p>

<p>It was a few days after the snowshoe film had
been made that Mr. Pertell decided on getting
some scenes farther back in the woods than he
had yet gone for views. Ruth and Alice, with
Paul and Mr. Switzer, were alone needed for
those particular acts, and as there was a good
road part way it was decided to go as near as
possible in a sled, and use snowshoes for the
rest of the trip, since there had been quite a fall.</p>

<p>Mr. Pertell went along to see that the proper<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
posing and acting was carried out, and when he
reached the place he had Ruth and Alice go on
alone into the woods, Russ filming them as they
advanced. Later Paul and Mr. Switzer were to
come into the picture.</p>

<p>"That's about right," said the manager when
Ruth and Alice were in a dense thicket. They
were attired as the daughters of lumbermen,
and this particular scene was one in a drama to
be called "The Fall of a Tree."</p>

<p>"Begin now," ordered Mr. Pertell, and Ruth
and Alice started the "business," or acting, called
for. Russ was grinding away at the crank of
the camera.</p>

<p>Everything went off well and that part of the
play came to an end. For the next act another
background was to be selected, and Russ went
to it with his camera, leaving Ruth and Alice
standing together in the thicket.</p>

<p>"We have to wait a few minutes, while Paul
and Mr. Switzer go through their parts," said
Ruth. "Then we'll go over."</p>

<p>"All right," Alice said. "Oh, but isn't it perfectly
heavenly out here? I just love it at Elk
Lodge!"</p>

<p>"So do I, dear! Hark! What was that?"</p>

<p>A sound came from the bushes behind them<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>&mdash;a
growling, menacing sound, and as they heard
it the girls drew together in fright.</p>

<p>"It&mdash;it's some animal!" gasped Ruth. "Oh,
Alice!"</p>

<p>"Look. There it is! It's going to spring at
us!" cried the younger girl and with trembling
finger she pointed to a crouching beast not far
away. Its eyes gleamed balefully, and with
sharp switchings of its tail it glared at the girls,
ready to spring.</p>

<p>The moving picture girls were faint with fear,
and too frightened to shout for help. But suddenly
a voice behind them called:</p>

<p>"Don't be afraid! Stand still. I'm going to
shoot!"</p>

<p>The next moment a shot rang out. The beast
quivered and then whirled in its death struggle,
while strong arms reached through the floating
powder smoke, and pulled Ruth and Alice back,
and out of danger.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>

<h3>IN THE CAVE</h3>


<p>The animal, in its death struggle, bit and
clawed at the snow and bushes about it, and actually
came almost to the feet of the shrinking
girls; but they were safe from harm, for the shot
had come just in time.</p>

<p>"I guess I'll have to give him another bullet,"
said the man who had ended the career of the
beast. "I'll put it out of its misery," and he did
so. The shot, so close at hand, caused Ruth and
Alice to jump nervously, and then, for the first
time, as the beast stretched out, and lay still,
they took a look at their rescuer.</p>

<p>"Why it's Flaming Arrow!" exclaimed Alice,
in delight.</p>

<p>"At your service!" he laughed. "I am glad
I happened to be near here."</p>

<p>"So are we!" exclaimed Ruth, with a nervous
laugh. "What sort of a beast is that&mdash;a young
bear?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, it's a wildcat, and a mean sort of animal,
once it attacks you. This one must have felt
that it was cornered, for they are not usually so
bold. It's a big one, though, and the pelt will
make a fine rug for your room. May I have the
pleasure of sending it to you?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, can you make it into a rug?" asked
Alice.</p>

<p>"Yes, I know something of curing, and I have
the materials at my shack in the lumber camp.
I'll make a rug for you, only I'm afraid it isn't
big enough for two," he said, ruefully.</p>

<p>"Oh, Alice may have it!" exclaimed Ruth,
generously.</p>

<p>"Then I'll get another for you," offered Flaming
Arrow. "They usually travel in pairs, and
the mate of this one is sure to be around somewhere.
I'll get him."</p>

<p>Later the Indian did get another wildcat,
whether or not the mate of the first one he shot
could not be determined; but, at any rate, Ruth
and Alice each received a handsome fur rug for
their room.</p>

<p>The sound of the shots brought up the others
of the moving picture company, and Paul turned
rather pale when he realized the danger Alice
had been in.</p>

<p>"Why didn't you call for help?" he asked.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<p>"We didn't need to. Flaming Arrow was
right on the spot when he was needed," replied
Alice.</p>

<p>"I happened to be out on a little hunting trip,"
the Indian explained, "and I saw the wildcat
sneak in this thicket. I did not see the girls,
though, until just as it was about to jump on
them. Then I fired."</p>

<p>"And just in time, too," declared Ruth. "Oh,
if that beast had ever jumped on me I don't
know what I'd have done!"</p>

<p>"They're pretty bad scratchers," said Flaming
Arrow. "I was clawed by one once, and I carry
the scars yet."</p>

<p>"Will you be able to go on with the play?"
asked Mr. Pertell of the girls, when he had heard
the story.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," returned Alice. "My nerves are
all right now. We are getting used to such experiences,"
she laughed.</p>

<p>"I am all right too," Ruth agreed. "But it
was a trying moment."</p>

<p>Flaming Arrow stood to one side and looked
on interestedly while the remainder of the drama
was being filmed, and then he showed the players
the road to his lumber camp. He invited them to
come over to it, but as the hour was late and as
Mr. Pertell wanted to get a few more scenes in a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
different locality, it was decided to defer the visit
to some other time.</p>

<p>Flaming Arrow said good-bye, and went off
with the dead wild cat slung over his shoulder.</p>

<p>"Isn't he just fine!" exclaimed Alice, as she
watched him stalking over the drifts on his snowshoes.</p>

<p>"I'm getting jealous!" laughed Paul, and
there was more of meaning in his remark than
his outward manner indicated.</p>

<p>"Well, I do like him!" Alice went on. "He
is so big and strong and manly. And he can
shoot straight!"</p>

<p>"Hereafter I'll bring along a gun every time
we come out," vowed Paul. "And I'm going to
take shooting lessons."</p>

<p>"Yah! Dot vould be a goot t'ing," decided
Mr. Switzer. "I gets me too a gun!"</p>

<p>"Gracious! The game around here had better
seek new quarters!" laughed Alice. "Next
we'll be having Mr. Bunn and Mr. Sneed taking
up the calling of Nimrod."</p>

<p>Mr. DeVere was rather disturbed when he
heard the story of the wildcat, and once more
he spoke seriously of taking his daughters out
of moving picture work.</p>

<p>"I really am afraid something will happen to
you," he said. "I think you had better resign.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
I can earn enough for all of us now, for Mr.
Pertell has given me another advance in salary."</p>

<p>"Oh, Daddy! We simply couldn't give it
up!" cried Alice. "Could we, Ruth?"</p>

<p>"I wouldn't like to give it up," responded
Ruth, quietly. She was always less demonstrative
than her sister. "And really, Daddy, we
don't run into danger."</p>

<p>"I know, my dear, but danger seems to have
formed a habit, of late, of seeking you out,"
said the actor. "However, we will wait a few
days. I suppose it would be too bad to disappoint
Mr. Pertell now."</p>

<p>The next day, owing to a slight indisposition
on the part of Miss Pennington, a drama that
included her as one of the cast had to be postponed,
and as no other was ready to be filmed,
the players had a little holiday.</p>

<p>"Who wants to come for a trip to the ice
cave?" asked Russ, when he found that he
would not have to use his camera.</p>

<p>"What's the ice cave?" asked Ruth.</p>

<p>"Why, it's a cave made out of ice. There's
one about two miles from here, and Mr. Pertell
is thinking of having some scenes made
there. I'm to go out and size up the situation.
Want to come?"</p>

<p>"It sounds interesting," observed Ruth. "I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
believe I would like to go. Shall we, Alice?"</p>

<p>"Indeed, yes."</p>

<p>"Count me in!" cried Paul.</p>

<p>So a little later the four young people set off
for the ice cave. This was a natural curiosity
not far from Elk Lodge. Every year, at a waterfall
in a local stream, the ice piled up in fantastic
shapes. The flow of the water, and the effect
of the wind, made a large hollow or cave at the
cascade large enough to hold several persons.
Mr. Pertell had heard of it and had laid one
scene of a drama there.</p>

<p>There was a fairly good road almost to the ice
cave, and then came a trip across an unbroken
expanse of snow, the snowshoes being used, they
having been carried strapped to the backs of the
four.</p>

<p>"Oh, how beautiful!"</p>

<p>"See how the sun sparkles on the ice."</p>

<p>"And what big icicles!"</p>

<p>"Oh, if we could only keep that until Summer!"</p>

<p>Thus the young people cried as they saw the
beautiful ice cave. It was indeed a pretty sight.
Nature, unaided, had done more than man could
ever hope to achieve.</p>

<p>"Let's go inside," suggested Russ.</p>

<p>"Will it be safe?" asked Ruth.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, surely. Why, we have to go in it when
we make the moving picture, so we might as
well get used to it. They say this ice lasts nearly
all summer. It's down in a deep hollow, you see.
Come on in."</p>

<p>"Go ahead! I'm game!" Paul said, grimly.</p>

<p>The girls hesitated, but only for a moment.
Then they followed the young men into the
cavern.</p>

<p>The entrance was rather small, and they had
to stoop to get through it, but once inside the
cave widened out until there was room for perhaps
a dozen persons.</p>

<p>"What a lovely place for a dance!" cried
Alice, as she slid about. "It's so slippery that
you'd need those new slippers with rubber set
in the sole. Come, on, try a hesitation waltz,"
she cried gaily to Ruth.</p>

<p>Paul whistled one of the latest popular airs,
and Ruth and Alice slid about.</p>

<p>"Come on!" cried Paul to Russ. "I'm getting
the craze, too."</p>

<p>The two young men danced together a moment,
and then came an interruption that caused
them all to look at one another.</p>

<p>There was a grinding, crashing sound outside,
and the next moment the entrance to the cave
was darkened.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>

<h3>THE RESCUE</h3>


<p>"What happened?"</p>

<p>"There must have been an ice slide!"</p>

<p>It was Alice who asked the question, and Paul
who answered it. Standing in the darkened ice
cave, through the walls of which, however, some
light filtered, the four looked anxiously at one
another.</p>

<p>"It was the dancing that did it," declared
Ruth, in a low voice. "It loosened the ice and
it slid down."</p>

<p>"Perhaps not," said Paul, not wanting Alice
blamed, for she had proposed the light-footed
stepping about on the slippery floor of the cavern.
"It might have slid down itself."</p>

<p>"Well, let's see what the situation is," proposed
Russ. "We can't stay in here too long,
for it's freezing cold."</p>

<p>"Yes, let's see if we can get out," added Paul.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>

<p>"See if we <i>can</i> get out!" repeated Ruth.
"Why, is there any danger that we can not?"</p>

<p>"Every danger in the world, I should say,"
spoke Russ, and there was a worried note in his
voice. "I don't want to alarm you," he went on,
"but the fact is that we are shut up in this ice
cave."</p>

<p>"Oh, don't say that!" cried Ruth.</p>

<p>"Why shouldn't he&mdash;if it's true?" asked Alice.
"Let's face the situation, whatever it is. Russ,
will you see just how bad it is?"</p>

<p>Without speaking, the young moving picture
operator went to the hole through which they
had stooped to enter the cavern. In a moment
he came back.</p>

<p>"It's closed tighter than a drum," he announced.
"A lot of ice slid down from above
and closed the entrance to the cave as if a door
had been shoved across it. We can't get out!"</p>

<p>For a moment no one spoke, and then Paul
asked, quietly:</p>

<p>"What are we going to do?"</p>

<p>"Have you a knife?" asked Russ.</p>

<p>"A knife? Yes, but what good is that?"</p>

<p>"We've got to cut our way out&mdash;that's all."</p>

<p>Ruth and Alice looked at each other. They
began to understand what it meant.</p>

<p>"Someone from Elk Lodge may come for us<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>&mdash;if
we don't get back," murmured the younger
girl, in what was almost a whisper.</p>

<p>"Yes, they may, but it's dangerous to wait,"
said Paul. "It is cold in here, and it isn't getting
any warmer. It's like being locked in a
refrigerator. We've got to keep in motion or
we'll freeze."</p>

<p>"Then let's tackle that block of ice at the
entrance," suggested Russ. "Get out your
knife and we'll see if we can't cut a hole large
enough to crawl through."</p>

<p>If you have tried to cut with a pocket knife
even the small piece of ice which you get in your
refrigerator, you can appreciate the task that confronted
the two young men. A solid block of ice
had slid down from some higher point, and had
blocked the opening to the odd cavern. But the
two were not daunted. They realized the necessity
of getting out, and that within a short time.
Though they were all warmly dressed, the air
of the cavern was chilly, to say the least.</p>

<p>"Keep moving, girls!" called Russ to Ruth
and Alice, as he and Paul chipped away at the
ice. "This exercise will keep us warm; but you
need to do something to keep your blood in circulation.
Here, take my coat!" he called, as he
arose from his knees, and tossed the garment to
Ruth.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<p>"I shall do nothing of the sort!" she answered,
promptly. "You need it yourself."</p>

<p>"No, I don't," he replied, earnestly. "It only
bothers me when I try to cut the ice. Please
take it."</p>

<p>"But I can't get it on over my cloak."</p>

<p>"Yes, you can. Put it around your shoulders.
I'll show you how." And he did it quickly, wrapping
it warmly around her.</p>

<p>"Here, Alice, you take mine!" cried Paul, as
he saw what his companion had done. "You
need it more than I do, and I can't get at that
ice with a big coat like this on."</p>

<p>In spite of her protests he put it about her, and
the added warmth of the garments was comforting
to the girls.</p>

<p>The boys, really, were better off without them,
for they had much vigorous work before them,
and in the narrow quarters the heavy coats only
hampered them.</p>

<p>For it was an exceedingly narrow space in
which they had to work. The fall of the mass
of ice had crushed part of the opening into the
cave, so that Russ and Paul had to crouch down
and stoop in a most uncomfortable position in
order to reach the block that had closed the
doorway.</p>

<p>With their knives they hacked away at the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
frozen mass, sending the chips flying. Much of
it went in their faces and soon their cheeks were
glowing from the icy spray of splinters. Then,
too, they had to stop every now and then to clear
away the accumulated ice crystals that fell before
the attack of their knives.</p>

<p>"Keep moving, girls," Paul urged Ruth and
Alice. "Keep circling around or you'll surely
freeze."</p>

<p>"Let's dance," suggested Alice.</p>

<p>"Oh, how can you think of such a thing!"
cried Ruth, "when it was that which caused all
the trouble."</p>

<p>"I'm not going to believe that!" declared
Alice, firmly. "And it isn't such a terrible thing
to think of, at all. It will keep us warm, and
keep up our spirits."</p>

<p>And then she broke into a little one-step dance,
whistling her own accompaniment. Surely it was
a strange proceeding, and yet it came natural to
Alice. The young men, too, took heart at her
manner of accepting the situation, and chopped
away harder than ever at the ice barrier.</p>

<p>"Think we'll make it?" asked Paul of Russ,
in a low voice, when they had been working for
some time.</p>

<p>"We've got to make it," answered the other.
"We've just got to get the girls out."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<p>"Of course," was the brief reply, as if that
was all there was to it.</p>

<p>And yet, in their hearts, Russ and Paul felt a
nameless fear. Ice, which melts so easily under
the warm and gentle influence of the sun, is exceedingly
hard when it is maintained at a low
temperature, and truly it was sufficiently cold in
the cave.</p>

<p>Now and then the boys stopped to clear away
the accumulation of ice splinters, and to note how
they were progressing. Yet they could hardly
tell, for they did not know how thick was the
chunk of ice that covered the cave opening. The
edges of the opening itself were several feet in
thickness, and if this hole was completely filled it
would mean many hours of work with the pitifully
inadequate tools at their disposal.</p>

<p>"How are we coming on?" asked Paul.</p>

<p>Russ looked back at the girls who, in one corner
of the cave, were pacing up and down to
drive away the deadly cold.</p>

<p>"Not very well," he returned, in a low voice.
"Don't talk&mdash;let's work."</p>

<p>He did not like to think of what might happen.</p>

<p>Desperately they labored, eating their way into
the heart of the ice. The splinters fell on their
warm bodies, for they were perspiring now, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
there the frosty particles melted, wetting their
garments through.</p>

<p>Suddenly Paul uttered a cry as he dug his
knife savagely into the barrier.</p>

<p>"What's the matter&mdash;cut yourself?" asked
Russ.</p>

<p>"No," was the low-voiced reply. "But I've
broken the big blade of my knife. Now I'll have
to use the smaller one."</p>

<p>It was a serious thing, for it meant a big decrease
in the amount of ice Paul could chop. But
opening the small blade of the knife he kept doggedly
at the task.</p>

<p>It was growing darker now. They could observe
this through the translucent walls of the
cave.</p>

<p>"Do you think they will come for us?" asked
Ruth, in a low tone.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, of course. If we don't get back by
dark," responded Russ, as cheerfully as he could.
"But we'll be out before then. Come on, Paul.
Dig away!"</p>

<p>But it was very evident that they would not be
out before dark. The ice block was thicker than
Russ and Paul imagined.</p>

<p>"Please rest!" begged Alice, after a period of
hard work by the two young men. "Please take
a rest!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<p>"Can't afford a vacation," returned Russ,
grimly.</p>

<p>But when he did halt for a moment, to get his
breath, there came from outside the cave a sound
that sent all their hearts to beating joyfully for it
was the voice of some calling:</p>

<p>"Where are you? Where are you? Alice!
Ruth!"</p>

<p>"Oh, it's daddy!" cried the girls together, and
then Russ took up the refrain, shouting:</p>

<p>"We're in the cave! Get axes and chop us
out! We've only got our knives!"</p>

<p>"We'll be with you in a moment!" said another
voice, which they recognized as that of
Mr. Macksey. "We'll have to go for a couple
of axes!"</p>

<p>And then, as the hunter started back to Elk
Lodge, Mr. DeVere, who remained outside the ice
cave, explained through a crevice in the ice wall
that made conversation possible how, becoming
uneasy at the failure of his daughters to return,
he had set out, in company with Mr. Macksey to
look for them.</p>

<p>In their turn Ruth and Alice, with occasional
words from Russ and Paul, told how they had
become imprisoned.</p>

<p>"Are you hurt?" asked Mr. DeVere, anxiously.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<p>"Not a bit of it, but we're awfully cold,
Daddy," replied Alice.</p>

<p>"We must give the boys back their coats," said
Ruth to her sister in a low tone. "They are not
chopping now, and they'll freeze."</p>

<p>Russ and Paul did not want to accept their
garments, but the girls were insistent, and made
them don the heavy coats. Then the four walked
rapidly around the cave to keep their blood in circulation.</p>

<p>"I wish Mr. Pertell would come and bring the
camera," said Russ. "He could get a good moving
picture of the rescue."</p>

<p>"Maybe he will," suggested Paul.</p>

<p>There was a little silence, and then Mr. DeVere
called, from outside the cave;</p>

<p>"Here they come! Now you will soon be rescued!
There's help enough to chop away the
whole cave!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>

<h3>SNOWBOUND</h3>


<p>Alice and Ruth fairly flew together, holding
their arms tightly about one another in the excess
of their emotion, as they heard this joyful news
shouted to them by their father.</p>

<p>Ruth cried on her sister's shoulder. She could
not help it. Perhaps Alice felt like crying, too,
so great was the relief; but she was of a different
<ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'temperment'">temperament</ins>. She laughed hysterically.</p>

<p>"Is Mr. Pertell there?" called Russ, getting
down close to the hole he and Paul had made in
the ice barrier to enable his voice to carry better.
"Is he there, Mr. DeVere?"</p>

<p>"Yes, he's there, and I guess the whole company."</p>

<p>"Has he the camera?"</p>

<p>"That's what he has, Russ."</p>

<p>"Good! Tell him to get a moving picture of
the rescue. We can fix up a story to go with it."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<p>"I will, Russ!" exclaimed the actor.</p>

<p>Then, as those within the ice cave waited,
they faintly heard other voices outside, and a little
later the sound of axes vigorously applied told
that the ice which had imprisoned them was being
chopped away.</p>

<p>Fast and furiously the rescuers worked. The
ice flew about in a sparkling spray as the keen
weapons bit deep into it, and the hole grew larger
and larger.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Mr. Pertell was operating the moving
picture camera, getting view after view of the
rescue. There were enough helpers so that his
aid was not needed in chopping the ice.</p>

<p>"There she goes!" cried Mr. Macksey, as his
axe went through an opening and into the cave.
"I've made the hole!" and he capered about like
a boy, so delighted was he that he had been the
first to bring aid to the imprisoned ones.</p>

<p>"Oh, now we can get out!" cried Ruth, as she
saw the head of the axe come through.</p>

<p>"As if there had ever been any doubt of it,"
laughed Alice. She could laugh now, but even
with all her gay spirits, there had been a time, not
many minutes back, when it was quite a different
story.</p>

<p>The hole once made, was soon enlarged, and
then, when it was of sufficient size to enable a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
person to crawl through, Russ shouted to the
rescuers;</p>

<p>"That'll do! Don't chop any more! We can
wriggle out."</p>

<p>"Surely, yes," agreed Ruth, as the young moving
picture operator looked to her for confirmation.
"I'm not a bit fussy," she added. "I've
done harder things than crawl on my hands and
knees out of an ice cave."</p>

<p>"Don't chop any more!" called Paul, for Russ
was leading Ruth to the opening.</p>

<p>"Come ahead!" called Mr. DeVere, and a
moment later he was holding his daughter in his
arms. Alice soon followed, and she too was
clasped tightly.</p>

<p>"Hurray!" cried Mr. Switzer, as Russ and
Paul emerged from their strange prison. "Dis is
der best sight vot I have yet had in more as a
month. Half a pretzel!" he exclaimed, holding
out one of the queer, twisted things. He was
never without them since the sled breakdown.
He said they were his mascots.</p>

<p>There was a scene of rejoicing, and even the
gloomy Mr. Sneed condescended to smile, and
looked almost happy.</p>

<p>"There, I guess we can use this film in some
sort of a play, if I have to write it myself!" exclaimed
Mr. Pertell, as he finished grinding away<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
at the camera crank. "I can call it 'Caught in
The Ice,' or something like that," he went on,
"We can make some preliminary scenes, and
some others to follow, and get quite a play out of
it."</p>

<p>"I'm glad you thought to bring the camera,"
said Russ. Even in the stress of what had happened
to him and his companions, his instinct as
a moving picture operator was ever foremost.</p>

<p>"We had better get them to Elk Lodge, and
feed them upon something warm," suggested Mr.
Macksey. "I told the wife to have a good
meal ready, for I knew they would be chilled
through."</p>

<p>"It <i>was</i> pretty cold in there," confessed Alice.</p>

<p>"Oh, don't let's talk about it!" cried Ruth.
"It was too terrible."</p>

<p>An examination of the exterior of the ice cave
showed that just what the young men surmised
had taken place. A large chunk of ice had slid
down from above, and had jammed against the
opening to the cavern.</p>

<p>Back at Elk Lodge, with warm garments on,
the four who had passed through such a trying
experience soon forgot their troubles. They had
to tell all over again just what had happened, and
the young men were considered quite the heroes
of the hour.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p>The next day none of the four was any the
worse for the experience, save in the matter of a
nightmare memory, and that would gradually
pass away.</p>

<p>Feeling that the two girls were not capable of
doing any hard work in posing for the camera
that day, Mr. Pertell announced another vacation,
save that Russ was engaged in making some
scenes of snow and ice effects.</p>

<p>Late in the afternoon, when the shadows were
lengthening, and the long winter evening was
about to close in, Alice, who was out on the side
porch, saw Mr. Macksey coming in from the barn.
The hunter had an anxious look on his face, and
as he walked toward the house he cast looks up at
the sky now and then. And Alice heard him
murmur:</p>

<p>"I don't like this! I don't for a cent, by
hickory!"</p>

<p>"What's the matter now?" she asked, merrily.
"Have you seen some of those strange men about
again, hunting on your preserves?"</p>

<p>"No, Miss Alice. Not this time," he replied,
slowly.</p>

<p>"What is it then?"</p>

<p>"Well, to tell you the truth, I don't like the
looks of the weather."</p>

<p>"Do you think we're going to have another<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
blizzard?" and there was a note of alarm in her
voice.</p>

<p>"I'm thinking that's what's coming," he made
answer. "I never knew the weather to act just
this way before except once, and then we had the
worst storm I ever remember. That was when
I was a boy, and more snow fell in that one storm
than in any three winters put together."</p>

<p>"Gracious! I hope that won't happen now!"
cried the girl.</p>

<p>"So do I," went on the hunter. "And I'm going
to take all precautions. I'll get the men, and
we'll pile the fodder in the barn so if we can't get
out to feed the stock they won't starve for a week,
anyhow."</p>

<p>"Does it ever happen that you can't get out to
the barns?" Alice wanted to know.</p>

<p>"Indeed it does, young lady. When there is a
heavy fall of snow, and the wind blows hard, it
drifts almost as high as the house. Yes, I think
we're in for a storm, and I'm going to get ready
for it. Best to be on the safe side."</p>

<p>A little later he and a number of his hired men,
as well as some of the picture players, were engaged
in looking after the horses and cows. Great
piles of hay and grain were moved from the barns
where the fodder was kept in reserve, to the
buildings where the stock were stabled.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>"How about our rations?" asked Mr. Bunn,
who was not of much help in work of this sort.
"Have we enough to last through a storm?"</p>

<p>"Well, we've got some," Mr. Macksey admitted.
"But I own I would like a little better stock
in the Lodge. I counted on some supplies coming
in to-day; but they haven't arrived. We'll have
to do the best we can."</p>

<p>"What is all the excitement about, Alice?"
asked Ruth as she came out to join her sister on
the porch.</p>

<p>"A big storm coming, Mr. Macksey says.
They're getting ready for it. I want to see it!"</p>

<p>"Oh, Alice. Suppose it should be a blizzard!"</p>

<p>"Well, I want to see it anyhow. If it's going
to come I can't stop it; but I can enjoy it," Alice
remarked in her characteristically philosophical
way.</p>

<p>There was a curious humming in the air, as
though someone, a great way off, were moaning
in pain. It did not seem to be the wind, and yet
it was like the sigh of a breeze. But the gaunt-limbed
trees did not bow before this strange blast.</p>

<p>The air, too, had a bite and tingle to it as
though it were filled with invisible particles of
ice. The clouds were lowering, and as the afternoon
wore away there sprang up in the west a
black band of vapor, almost like ink.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<p>Alice induced Ruth to pay a visit to the barn,
to watch the preparations for providing for the
stock. Even the animals seemed uneasy, as
though they sensed some impending disaster.
The horses, always nervous, were doubly so, and
moved restlessly about, with pricked-up ears,
and startled neighs. The cows, too, lowed plaintively.</p>

<p>"Well, we've done all we can," announced Mr.
Macksey, as night came on. "Now all we can
do is to wait. There's plenty of fuel in the cellar,
and we'll not freeze, at any rate."</p>

<p>There was a sense of gloom over all, as they
sat in the big living room of Elk Lodge that
night, and looked at the blazing logs. Everyone
listened apprehensively, as though to hear the
first message of the impending storm.</p>

<p>The sighing of the wind, if wind it was that
made that curious sound, was more pronounced
now, and as the blast came down the chimney it
scattered ashes and embers about, and at times
rose to an uncanny wail.</p>

<p>"Oh, but that gives me the shivers!"
exclaimed Miss Pennington, tossing aside the
novel in which she had tried to become interested.
"This is positively awful! I wish I were back in
New York."</p>

<p>"So do I!" added her chum.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, but a good snow storm is glorious!"
cried Alice. "I am just wild to see it."</p>

<p>"That's right," exclaimed her father, with a
smile. "Take a cheerful view of it, anyhow."</p>

<p>Some one proposed a guessing game, and with
that under way the spirits of all revived somewhat.
Then came another simple game, and the
time passed pleasantly.</p>

<p>Mr. Macksey, coming back from a trip to the
side door, startled them all by announcing:</p>

<p>"She's here!"</p>

<p>"Who?" asked his wife, looking up from her
sewing.</p>

<p>"The storm! It's snowing like cotton batting!"</p>

<p>Alice rushed to the window. She shaded her
eyes with her hands at the side of her head and
peered out. It seemed as though the lamplights
shone on a solid wall of white, so thickly was the
snow falling.</p>

<p>The wind had now risen to a blast of hurricane-like
velocity and it fairly shook Elk Lodge,
low and substantial as the house was.</p>

<p>By ones and twos the picture players went to
their rooms, and soon silence and darkness settled
down over the Lodge. That is, silence within
the house, but outside there was the riot of the
storm.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<p>Two or three times during the night Alice
awakened and, going to the window, looked out.
She could make out a dim whiteness, but that was
all. Around the window there was a little drift
of snow on the sill, where it had been blown
through a crack.</p>

<p>And in the morning they were snowbound. So
heavy was the fall of snow, and so high had it
drifted, that some of the lower windows were
completely covered, from the ground up. And
before each door was such a drift that it would be
necessary to tunnel if they were to get out.</p>

<p>"The worst storm I ever see!" declared Mr.
Macksey, as he closed the door against the blast.
"It would be death to go out in it now. We are
snowbound, by hickory!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>

<h3>ON SHORT RATIONS</h3>


<p>Apprehensive as all had been of the coming
of the big storm, and fully warned by the hunter,
none of the picture players was quite prepared
for what they saw&mdash;or, rather, for what they
could not see. For not a window on the lower
floor of the Lodge but was blocked by a bank of
snow, so that only the tops of the upper panes
were clear of it. And through those bits of glass
all that could be seen was a whirling, swirling
mass, for the white flakes were still falling.</p>

<p>Not an outer door of the house but was blocked
by a drift, and it was useless to open the portals
at present, as the snow fell into the room.</p>

<p>"But what are we to do?" asked Mr. Pertell,
when the situation had been made plain to him.
"We can't take any moving pictures; can we?"</p>

<p>"Not in this storm," Mr. Macksey declared.
"It would be as much as your life is worth to go
out. It is bitter cold and the wind cuts like a
knife!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>

<p>"I wish I could get some views," spoke Russ.
"It would give New York audiences something
to talk about, to see moving pictures of a storm
like this."</p>

<p>"You might go up in the cupola on the roof,"
suggested Mr. Macksey. "You could stand your
camera up there and possibly get some views."</p>

<p>"I'll do it!" cried Russ.</p>

<p>"And may I come?" asked Alice, always
ready for an adventure of that sort.</p>

<p>"Come along!" he cried, gaily.</p>

<p>The cupola was more for ornament than use,
but it was large enough for the purpose of Russ.
After breakfast he took his moving picture camera
up there, and managed through the windows,
to get some fairly good pictures. The trouble
was, however, that the snow was falling so
thickly that it obscured the view. At times there
would come a lull in the storm, and then Russ
was able to get scenes showing the great black
woods, and the white banks of snow.</p>

<p>"Oh, but it's cold work!" he cried, as he
stopped to warm his hands, for the little room on
the roof was draughty, and the snow blew in.</p>

<p>"It's a wonderful storm," cried Alice. "I
wouldn't have missed it for worlds!"</p>

<p>All that day the storm raged, and all that night.
There was nothing which could be done out of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
doors, and so the players and the men of the
Lodge were forced to remain within. Great
fires were kept up, for the temperature was very
low.</p>

<p>The wise forethought of Mr. Macksey in providing
for the stock prevented the animals from
starving, as they would have done had not a supply
of fodder been left for them. For it was out
of the question to get to the barns.</p>

<p>After two days the storm ceased, the skies
cleared and the sun shone. But on what a totally
different scene than before the coming of the
great blizzard!</p>

<p>There had been plenty of snow in Deerfield
before, but now there was so much that one old
man, who worked for Mr. Macksey, said he never
recalled the like, and he had seen many bad
storms.</p>

<p>"Well, now to tunnel out!" exclaimed Mr.
Macksey when it had been ascertained, by an observation
from the cupola, that the fall of snow
was over. "We'll see if we can't raise the embargo."</p>

<p>But it was no easy matter. All the doors were
blocked by drifts, and in making a tunnel through
snow it is just as necessary to have some place to
put the removed material as it is in tunneling
through the side of a hill.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

<p>"We can't start in and dig from the door, for
we'd have to pile the snow in the room back of
us," said the hunter. "So the only other plan is
to get outside, somehow, and work up to the
house, tossing the snow to one side. I may have
to dig a trench instead of a tunnel. I'll soon
find out."</p>

<p>Finally it was decided that the men should go
to the second story, out on a balcony that opened
from Mr. DeVere's room, and get down into the
snow that way. They would use snowshoes so as
to have some support, and thus they could attack
the drifts.</p>

<p>This plan was followed. Fortunately Mr.
Macksey had thought to bring in snow shovels
before the storm came, and with these the men
attacked the big white piles.</p>

<p>It was hard work, but they labored with a will,
and there were enough of them to make an effective
attack. Mr. Macksey, in spite of the fact
that he had food and water for his stock, was
anxious to see how the animals were doing. So
he directed that first paths, tunnels or trenches be
made to the various barns.</p>

<p>In some places, around the lee of a building,
the ground was bare of snow, and in other places
the drifts were fully fifteen feet high.</p>

<p>Russ, who had not gone out to shovel snow,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
was observed to be nailing some light broad
boards together in a peculiar way.</p>

<p>"What are you making?" Ruth asked him.</p>

<p>"Snowshoes for my camera," was his surprising
answer.</p>

<p>"Snowshoes for your camera?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I want to get out and take some views,
but I can't stand the thin legs of the camera on
the snow. They'd pierce through it. So I'm going
to put a broad board under each leg, and that
will hold the machine up as well as snowshoes
hold me."</p>

<p>"What a clever idea!" she cried. "I'm going
to watch you. What sort of views do you expect
to get?"</p>

<p>"Some showing the men digging us out. We
can get up a film story and call it 'Prisoners of
the Snow,' or something like that."</p>

<p>"Fine!" cried Alice. "I'm coming out, too."</p>

<p>She and Ruth got their snowshoes, and by
this time the men had a deep trench up to the
front door, so that it was not necessary for the
girls to go out by the way of the balcony. They
were delighted with the strange scene, and Russ
obtained many fine pictures of the men laboring
in the snow.</p>

<p>It was hard work to tunnel and trench out to
the barn where the animals were, but finally it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
was done. They were found to be all right with
two exceptions. A horse had died from getting
into the oat bin and eating too much, and a cow
was frozen, having gotten away from the rest,
and broken into a small outbuilding.</p>

<p>But the rest of the stock was in good condition,
and, as Alice said, they seemed almost human,
neighing or lowing at the sight of the men.</p>

<p>"I believe they were actually lonesome," said
Alice.</p>

<p>"Indeed, animals do get that way!" declared
Mr. Macksey.</p>

<p>As the snow was so deep, no dramas could be
filmed in it, so Mr. Pertell and his players were
enjoying enforced idleness. The time was spent,
however, in learning new parts, in readiness for
the time when some of the snow should have
melted.</p>

<p>Many more paths, tunnels and trenches were
made, but it was impossible to go more than a
short distance from Elk Lodge, even on snowshoes.
Later, when the snow had packed more,
and a crust had been formed, it was planned to
take many pictures of various happenings in the
great piles of white crystals.</p>

<p>Three days after the storm saw little change
in the appearance of the country and landscape
about the hunting lodge. It was snow, snow,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
snow everywhere&mdash;on all sides. Within the
house it was warm and cozy, and for months
afterward it was a pleasant recollection to talk
of the hours spent about the great fire in the living
room.</p>

<p>But in spite of the fact that his animals were
safe, except for the two that had died, Mr. Macksey
seemed worried. Several times he paid a visit
to the cellar, or the store room, where the provisions
were kept, and more than once the girls
heard him murmuring to himself.</p>

<p>"What is the trouble?" Alice asked him once,
as he came up from a trip to the cellar.</p>

<p>"Well, I'm afraid you folks will have to go
on short rations if the supplies don't come in soon
from the store," he replied. "I've got plenty of
meat on hand, but other things are somewhat
scarce."</p>

<p>"Then we won't starve?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Well, maybe not actually starve, but you may
be hungry for certain things."</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm not fussy!" Alice laughed. "I can
eat anything."</p>

<p>The storm was so severe and so wide-spread,
that, in about a week, there was an actual shortage
of provisions at Elk Lodge. The meals had to
be curtailed in regard to certain dishes, and there
were loud complaints from Mr. Bunn and Mr.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
Sneed, as well as from Miss Pennington and Miss
Dixon. But the others made the best of it.</p>

<p>"I wish I had never come to this horrid place!"
exclaimed Miss Pennington, when her request
for a fancy dish had to be denied.</p>

<p>"You may go back to New York any time you
wish," observed Mr. Pertell, with a grim humor,
as he looked out on the great piles of snow. It
would have been impossible to get half-way to the
station.</p>

<p>Miss Pennington "sniffed" and said nothing.</p>

<p>But there was no actual suffering at Elk
Lodge. Before it got to that point Mr. Macksey
hitched up six horses to a big sled and made his
way into town. He brought back enough provisions
for a small company of soldiers.</p>

<p>"Now let it 'bliz' if it wants to!" he cried,
as he and his men stocked up the storeroom.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>

<h3>THE THAW</h3>


<p>"Now for some hard work," said Mr. Pertell
one day, about ten days after the big storm. "I
think we can safely go out, and make some of the
scenes in the play 'Snowbound,'" he went on.
"There will not be much danger that we will be
caught in another blizzard; will there?" he asked
of Mr. Macksey.</p>

<p>"I should hope not!" was the answer. "I
don't believe there is any snow left in the clouds.
Still, don't take too many chances. Don't go
more than ten miles away."</p>

<p>"Oh, I wasn't thinking of going half that distance!"
said Mr. Pertell. "I just want to get a
scene or two at some place where the snow is
piled in fantastic forms. The rest of the story
takes place around the Lodge here."</p>

<p>"Is it the one that is something like the story
of Lorna Doone?" asked Alice, who had been
reading that book.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>

<p>"That's the one," said Mr. Pertell. "And I
think I shall cast you as Lorna."</p>

<p>"Oh, how nice!" she laughed. "But who will
be John Ridd? We need a great big man for
him!"</p>

<p>"Well, I was thinking of using Mr. Macksey,"
went on the manager, with a look at the
hunter.</p>

<p>"What? Me have my photograph took in
moving pictures!" cried the keeper of the Lodge.
"Why, I don't know how to act!"</p>

<p>"You know how a great deal better than some
that are in the business," returned Mr. Pertell,
coolly. "Present company always excepted," he
added, as Mr. Bunn looked up with an injured
air. "What I mean is that you are so natural,"
he continued. "In fact, you have had your pictures
taken a number of times lately, when you
and your men were clearing away the snow. So
you see it will be no novelty for you."</p>

<p>"But I didn't know when you took my pictures!"
objected the hunter.</p>

<p>"No, and that's just the point. Don't think of
the camera at all. Be unconscious of it. I'll arrange
to have it masked, or hidden, if you think
you can do better that way. But I have some
scenes calling for a big man battling in the snow
to save a girl, and you and Miss Alice are the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
proper characters. So I hope you won't disappoint
me."</p>

<p>"I'll do my best," promised Mr. Macksey.
"But I'm not used to that sort of work."</p>

<p>However, when the preliminary scenes for the
big drama were filmed he did some excellent acting,
the more so as he was totally unconscious
that he was acting.</p>

<p>Several days were spent in making films of the
play, for Mr. Pertell wanted to take advantage
of the snow.</p>

<p>"It won't last a great while longer," remarked
the hunter. "It's getting warm, and there'll be a
thaw, soon."</p>

<p>He proved to be a true weather prophet for in
two weeks there was scarcely a vestige of the
snow left. It grew warm, and rained, and there
was so much water about, from the rain and melting
snow, that it was nearly as difficult to get
about as it had been in the big drifts.</p>

<p>But the thaw proved an advantage in one way,
for it opened up the roads that had been well-nigh
impassable, and mail and other supplies came
through.</p>

<p>The storm, while it gave Mr. Pertell a chance
to make some fine pictures, had one drawback.
He was not able to send the reels of film in to
New York for development and printing. He<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
lost considerable time and some money on this
account, but it could not be helped.</p>

<p>But with the passing of the snow the highways
were clear, and traffic to and from the village
was made easy.</p>

<p>One day Mr. Macksey came back from town
with a good-sized bag, filled with mail for the
picture players.</p>

<p>"Oh, here's a letter for you, Ruth, and one for
me!" cried Alice, as she sorted them over. "One
for daddy, too! Oh, it's a big one!"</p>

<p>The moving picture girls were busy over their
epistles for some time, as there proved to be a
number of missives for them, from relatives, and
from friends they had made since posing for the
camera. But when Alice read all hers and was
passing some of them to her sister, she happened
to glance at her father's face.</p>

<p>"Why Daddy!" she cried, "what is the matter?"</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;nothing!" he murmured, hoarsely for
he had caught a little cold, and his voice was almost
as bad as it had been at first.</p>

<p>"But I'm sure it's something!" Alice insisted.
"Is it bad news? Ruth, make him tell!"</p>

<p>The three were in Mr. DeVere's room, where
they had gone to look over the mail.</p>

<p>"Oh, it isn't anything!" declared the actor,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
and he tried to slip into his coat pocket the letter
in the large envelope that Alice had handed to
him.</p>

<p>"I'm sure it is," she insisted. "Please tell
me, Daddy."</p>

<p>The letter fell to the floor, and Alice could not
help seeing that it was from a firm of New York
lawyers.</p>

<p>"Oh, is it the trouble about the five hundred
dollars?" the girl cried. "Is Dan Merley making
more trouble?"</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Mr. DeVere. "He has
brought suit against me, it seems. This is a notice
from the lawyers that if I do not pay within
a certain time I will be brought to court, and compelled
to hand over the money."</p>

<p>"Can they make you do that, Daddy?" asked
Ruth, anxiously.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid they can, my dear. As I told you,
I have no proof, except my own word, that I paid
Merley. He still holds my note, and that is legal
evidence against me. Oh, if I had only been
more business-like!"</p>

<p>"Never mind, Daddy!" Alice comforted him,
putting her arms about his neck. "Perhaps there
will be a way out."</p>

<p>"I hope so," her father murmured, in broken
tones.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<p>"How did the lawyers know you were here?"
asked Ruth.</p>

<p>"They didn't. They sent it to the apartment,
and the postman forwarded it to me."</p>

<p>"They can't sue you up here in this wilderness
though; can they?" asked Alice.</p>

<p>"I don't know anything about the law part of
it," replied Mr. DeVere. "I presume, though,
that they can sue me anywhere, even though I
have paid the money, as long as Merley holds that
note. They can make a great deal of trouble if
they wish."</p>

<p>"Poor Daddy!" Ruth sighed.</p>

<p>"Oh, but I mustn't make you worry this way,"
he said spiritedly. "I shall find some way to
fight this case. I'll never give in to that
scoundrel."</p>

<p>"I wonder where he is?" mused Alice. "We
thought he was injured in the accident, and
would not bother you."</p>

<p>"This notice does not mention him," replied
Mr. DeVere, as he paused over the letter again.
"It merely speaks of him as 'our client.' He
may be in the hospital, for all I can tell."</p>

<p>They discussed the matter from all viewpoints,
but there was nothing to be done.</p>

<p>"You will have to reply to the lawyers, though;
won't you, daddy?" asked Ruth.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I must write to them. I shall state
the case plainly, and, though, I have no proof, I
shall ask them to drop the suit, as it is an unjust
one."</p>

<p>"And if they don't?" suggested Alice.</p>

<p>"If they don't&mdash;well, I suppose I shall have to
suffer," he replied, quietly. "I cannot raise the
money now."</p>

<p>"Oh dear!" cried Alice, half petulantly. "I
wish the blizzard was still here!"</p>

<p>"Why, Alice!" cried Ruth.</p>

<p>"Well, I do! Then there wouldn't have been
any mail, and daddy wouldn't have received this
horrid letter."</p>

<p>"Oh, well, it's best to know the plans of one's
enemies," said Mr. DeVere. "Now I know what
to expect. I think I shall write to Dan Merley
myself, and appeal to his better nature. Surely,
even though he was not entirely sober when I paid
him the money, he must recall that I did. I confess
I do not know whether he is merely under
the impression that I did not pay him, or is deliberately
telling a falsehood. It is hard to decide,"
he added, with a sigh.</p>

<p>Mr. DeVere sent a letter to Merley the next
day, and a few days later an answer came back
from New York, from the same firm of lawyers
who had served the legal notice, to the effect that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
their client had left the matter entirely in their
hands, and that the money must be paid. Mr.
Merley, the lawyer said, preferred to have no direct
communication with Mr. DeVere.</p>

<p>"That settles it! They mean to push the case
to the limit!" exclaimed the actor.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI</h2>

<h3>IN THE STORM</h3>


<p>"That's the way to drive!"</p>

<p>"Come on now!"</p>

<p>"Faster, if you can make the horses go!"</p>

<p>"Get all that in, Russ!"</p>

<p>It was a lively scene, for a spirited race in cutters
was in progress between Mr. Bunn and Mr.
Sneed. It was taking place on the frozen surface
of the lake, and each actor had been instructed to
do his best to win. The race was a scene in the
big snow drama, and it was being filmed several
days after the events narrated in the preceding
chapter.</p>

<p>The thaw was over, there had been a spell of
cold weather, and Deerfield was icebound. The
lake was a glittering expanse, and the ice on it
was thick enough to support a regiment.</p>

<p>"A little more to the left, Mr. Sneed!" called
Russ, who was taking the pictures. "I want
to get a better side view."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>

<p>"But if I go too far to the left I'm afraid I'll
run into Mr. Bunn," objected the gloomy actor.</p>

<p>"No matter if you do&mdash;if you don't run into
him too hard," cried Mr. Pertell. "It will make
it look more natural."</p>

<p>"If he runs into me&mdash;and does me any damage&mdash;I
shall sue him and you too!" declared Mr.
Bunn. "This is a farcical idea, anyhow. You
said I might get a chance to do some Shakespearean
work up here; but so far I have done
nothing."</p>

<p>"I'll see what I can do on that line next week,"
promised the manager. "Go on with this race
now. The idea is for you, Mr. Sneed, to be in
pursuit of Mr. Bunn. You must look as though
you really wanted to catch him. Put some spirit
into your acting."</p>

<p>"It is too cold!" complained Mr. Sneed. "I
would a great deal rather be sitting beside the
fire in the Lodge."</p>

<p>"No doubt," commented Mr. Pertell, drily.
"But that won't make moving pictures. Come
on, now, start your horses again," for they had,
so far, been only rehearsing.</p>

<p>Finally Mr. Pertell was satisfied that the play
would be done to his satisfaction, and gave the
word for Russ to start unreeling the film.</p>

<p>Away started the two cutters over the ice, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
the two actors really managed to put a little enthusiasm
into their work. Then, as Russ called
to Mr. Sneed to edge over a little to the left, as
he had done before, at the rehearsal, the gloomy
actor pulled too hard on one rein. His horse
swerved too much, and, the next instant, the cutter
upset, and Mr. Sneed was neatly deposited
on the ice.</p>

<p>Fortunately he fell clear of the vehicle, and
was not entangled in the reins, so he was not hurt.
The horse, an intelligent animal, feeling that
something was wrong, came to a stop after running
a little distance.</p>

<p>"Stop! Stop!" called Mr. Pertell to Mr.
Bunn, who was still urging on his horse, unaware
of the accident to his fellow actor. "The scene
is spoiled. Don't take that, Russ. Sometimes I
like an accident on the film, but not in this case.
It would spoil the action of the play. It will have
to be done over again."</p>

<p>"Not with me in it!" said Mr. Sneed, as he
got up and went limping toward shore.</p>

<p>"Why not?" asked Mr. Pertell. "Why don't
you want to do this act?"</p>

<p>"Because I am hurt. I knew something would
happen when I got up this morning, and it certainly
has. I may be injured for life by this."</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" exclaimed the manager.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
"You're not hurt. You only think so. Here,
Mrs. Maguire, give him that bottle of witch hazel
I saw you use for little Tommy the other day.
That will fix you up, Mr. Sneed."</p>

<p>"Humph!" exclaimed the "grouch." And
then, as the motherly Irish woman, with a quizzical
smile on her face, started to the house for
the liniment, Mr. Sneed said:</p>

<p>"Oh, you needn't make such a fuss over me.
I suppose I can go on with this, if I am suffering.
Bring back the horse."</p>

<p>The overturned cutter was righted, and the
play went on. This time no mishap occurred and
the race was run to a successful finish.</p>

<p>"Now, Alice and Ruth, you will get into the
larger cutter, and with Paul for a driver we'll
make the next scene," directed Mr. Pertell, and
so the making of the play went on.</p>

<p>The filming of the big drama was to occupy
several days, as some of the scenes were laid in
distant parts of the game preserve belonging to
Elk Lodge, and there was not time to take the
company there, and come back for other scenes,
the darkness falling early, as the year was dying.</p>

<p>There came fair weather, and storms, alternating.
A number of fine films were obtained by
Russ, some of them showing weather effects, and
others views of the ice at the falls where the two<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
girls and their companions had been imprisoned
in the ice cave.</p>

<p>It was on one comparatively warm afternoon
that Alice, who had been out in the barn to give
some sugar to a favorite horse, came back and
called to Ruth:</p>

<p>"Let's go for a walk. It's perfectly lovely
out, and it will do us both good."</p>

<p>"All right!" agreed Ruth. "I've been sewing
all morning and my eyes are tired. Where are
you going?"</p>

<p>"Oh, in a direction we have never taken
before."</p>

<p>"Don't get lost," advised their father.</p>

<p>"We won't," returned Alice. "Don't you
want to come, Daddy?"</p>

<p>"Too busy. I'm studying a new part," he
said.</p>

<p>So the two moving picture girls started off, and
soon were tramping through the woods, following
an old lumber trail.</p>

<p>"This leads to the camp of Flaming Arrow,"
said Alice, for they had paid the promised visit
some time before. "Shall we take it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but not all the way to the lumber camp,"
objected Ruth. "That is too far."</p>

<p>"Oh, I wouldn't think of going there now,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
responded Alice. "I mean to branch off on the
new path I spoke of."</p>

<p>The day was pleasant, but there was the hint
of a storm in the feeling of the air and in the
clouds, and the hint was borne out a little later,
for a fine snow began sifting down.</p>

<p>The girls kept on, however though Ruth
wanted to turn back at the first white flake.</p>

<p>"There's going to be a storm," she declared.</p>

<p>"What of it?" asked Alice, with a merry
laugh. "It will be all the more fun!"</p>

<p>But a little later, when the wind suddenly
sprang into fury, and lashed the flakes into their
faces with cutting force, even Alice was ready to
turn back.</p>

<p>"Come on," she cried to her sister. "We'd better
not go to the snow grotto&mdash;that was a natural
curiosity I wanted to show you. But we'll have
to wait until another time."</p>

<p>"I should think so!" exclaimed Ruth. "This
is terrible! Oh, suppose we should be lost?"</p>

<p>"How can we be, when all we have to do is to
follow the path back to Elk Lodge?"</p>

<p>Alice thought it would be as easily done as she
had said, and Ruth trusted to the fact that her
sister had been that way on a previous occasion.
But neither of them realized the full force of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
storm, nor how easy it was to mistake the way in
blinding snow.</p>

<p>They emerged from a little clump of woods,
and then they felt the full force of the blast in
their faces.</p>

<p>"Oh, Alice, <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'We'">we</ins> can't go on!" cried Ruth,
halting and turning her face aside.</p>

<p>"But we must!" Alice insisted. "We've got
to get back. We can't stay out in this snow. It's
a small-sized blizzard now, and it is growing
worse."</p>

<p>"Oh, what shall we do?" cried Ruth, almost
sobbing.</p>

<p>"We must keep on!" declared Alice, grimly.</p>

<p>They locked arms and bent their heads before
the blast. They tried to keep to the path, but
after a few moments of battling with the storm,
Ruth cried:</p>

<p>"Alice where are we?"</p>

<p>"On the way to Elk Lodge, of course."</p>

<p>"No, we're not. We're off the path! See, we
didn't come past this big rock before," and she
pointed to one that reared up from the snow.</p>

<p>Alice paused for a moment, and then, with a
curious note of fear in her voice, she said:</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I am afraid we are lost, Ruth. Oh, it is
all my fault!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER XXII</h2>

<h3>THE THREE MEN</h3>


<p>They stood there together&mdash;the two moving
picture girls&mdash;in the midst of the sudden storm.
They stood with their arms about each other, and
the frightened eyes of Alice gazed into the terror-stricken
ones of Ruth.</p>

<p>"Alice," cried Ruth, "do you really think we
are lost?"</p>

<p>"I'm afraid so. I didn't notice which way we
were going; but, as you say, we didn't pass that
rock before. We must be lost!"</p>

<p>"But what are we to do?"</p>

<p>"We've got to do something, that's sure!"
Alice exclaimed. "We can't stay here and
freeze."</p>

<p>"Of course not. But if we go on in the storm
we may be snowed under."</p>

<p>"And I'm more afraid to stay here. We must
keep on the move, Ruth."</p>

<p>"Yes, I suppose so. Oh, if we could only see<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
our way! We can't be so very far from Elk
Lodge."</p>

<p>"We are not," agreed Alice. "We did not
walk fast, and we have not been gone very long.
The Lodge can't be more than two miles away;
but it might just as well be two hundred for all
the good that does us in this storm."</p>

<p>Indeed the snow was so thick that it was impossible
to see many feet ahead. The white
flakes swirled, seeming to come first from one
direction, and then from another. The wind
blew from all points of the compass, varying so
quickly that the girls found it impossible to keep
it at their backs.</p>

<p>"Well, there is one thing we can do," said
Alice, when they had advanced a few steps and
then retreated, not knowing whether it was better
to keep on or not.</p>

<p>"And what is it?" asked Ruth. "If there's
any one thing to do in a case like this I want to
know it."</p>

<p>"We can go over behind that rock and get a
little protection from the wind and snow," Alice
went on. "See, the snow has drifted on one side;
and the other is quite bare. That shows it affords
some shelter. Let's go over there."</p>

<p>"Come on," agreed Ruth. She caught her
sister's arm in a firmer grasp, and the two girls<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
plowed their way through the snow. They had,
heretofore, been on a sort of path, that had been
formed over the crust. The girls had on their
snowshoes or they would have scarcely been able
to progress. As it was the going was sufficiently
difficult.</p>

<p>"Oh, wait a moment!" panted Ruth, half way
to the sheltering rock.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" asked Alice, quickly.
"Are you ill?"</p>

<p>"No, don't worry about me, dear. I'm only&mdash;out
of breath!"</p>

<p>"I positively believe you're getting stout!"
laughed Alice, and Ruth was glad that she could
laugh, even in the face of impending danger.
"You must take more exercise," she went on.</p>

<p>"I'm getting plenty of it now," observed Ruth.
"Oh, but it is hard going in this snow!"</p>

<p>Together they struggled on, and finally reached
the rock. As Alice had surmised, the big boulder
did give them shelter, and they were grateful for
it, as they were quite exhausted by their battle
with the storm.</p>

<p>"What a relief!" sighed Alice, as she leaned
back against the big stone.</p>

<p>"Oh, isn't it!" agreed Ruth. "But, Alice,
if we are so played out by that little trip, how are
we ever going to get back to Elk Lodge?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't know, dear," was the hesitating answer.
"But we must get back. Maybe the snow
will stop after a little, and we can see our way.
That is really all we need&mdash;to see the path. I'm
sure I've been out in worse storms than this."</p>

<p>"It is bad enough," responded Ruth, apprehensively.
"See how it snows!"</p>

<p>Indeed the white flakes were coming down
with increased violence, and the wind swept and
howled about the rock with a melancholy sound.
The girls huddled close together.</p>

<p>"Can you ever forgive me for bringing you out
in such weather as this?" begged Alice, self-reproachfully.</p>

<p>"It wasn't your fault at all, dear," Ruth reassured
her and her arms went about her sister in
a loving embrace. "I wanted to come. Neither
of us knew this storm would make us get lost."</p>

<p>Alice said nothing for a moment. She was
busy arranging a scarf more tightly about her
throat, for she felt the flakes blowing and sifting
on her, and did not want to take cold. The girls
were warmly dressed, which was in their favor.</p>

<p>For five or ten minutes they remained under
the lee of the rock, not knowing what to do.
They realized, though neither wanted to mention
it to the other, that they could not remain there
very long. Night would settle down, sooner or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
later, and they could not remain out without
shelter. Yet where could they go?</p>

<p>"If it would only stop!" cried Ruth.</p>

<p>"Yes, or if someone from Elk Lodge would
come after us!" added Alice.</p>

<p>"I'm sure they will!" cried Ruth, catching at
this slender hope. "Oh, Alice, I'm sure they'll
come."</p>

<p>"And so am I, as far as that is concerned,"
agreed Alice. "The only trouble is they will not
know where to come. Don't you see?"</p>

<p>"But they know where we were going&mdash;you
mentioned it to daddy."</p>

<p>"I know, but don't you understand, my dear,
we're not where we said we would go. We're
lost&mdash;we're off the path. If it was only a question
of someone from the Lodge following the
proper path it would be all right. But we're far
from it, and they will have no idea where to
search for us."</p>

<p>"Couldn't they trail us with&mdash;with bloodhounds?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't believe it will get as desperate as
that. Not that there are any bloodhounds at Elk
Lodge. But there are some hunting dogs, and I
presume they might be able to follow our trail.
Won't it seem odd to be trailed by dogs? Just as
if we were <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'fugutive'">fugitive</ins> slaves!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't care how they trail us, as long as we
get back to Elk Lodge!" and there was a sob in
Ruth's voice.</p>

<p>The next moment Alice, on whose shoulder
Ruth had laid her head, uttered a cry.</p>

<p>"Oh, what is it?" asked the elder girl. "Do
you see someone? Are they coming for us?"</p>

<p>"No, but the snow is stopping, and I can see a
house&mdash;two of them, in fact."</p>

<p>"A house! Good! Is it far off?"</p>

<p>"No, not far. Come on, I believe we can reach
it."</p>

<p>As Alice had said, the snow had ceased falling
almost as suddenly as it had set in, and this gave
the girls a clear view. They had made a little
turn from their original direction in getting to the
rock, and they had a view down in a little glade.
There, as Alice had said, nestled two houses; or,
rather log cabins. One was of large size, and
the other smaller.</p>

<p>"Let's go there!" suggested Alice. "We can
get shelter, and perhaps there is someone in one
of the cabins who will take us to Elk Lodge. We
can offer to pay him."</p>

<p>"They wouldn't want it," declared Ruth.
"But come on. We mustn't lose any time, for
the snow may set in again at any moment. We
must get there while we can see."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>

<p>The wind, too, had died out somewhat, so that
it was comparatively easy travelling now. Together
the girls made their way over the snow
toward the smaller of the two cabins, that being
the nearer.</p>

<p>They reached it, struggling, panting and out
of breath, and after waiting a moment, to allow
their laboring hearts to quiet down, that they
might speak less brokenly, Alice knocked at the
door. There was no answer.</p>

<p>"Oh, suppose they should not be home?" cried
Ruth.</p>

<p>"That seems to be the case," spoke Alice, as
she knocked again, without result.</p>

<p>"What shall we do&mdash;go to the other cabin?"
asked Ruth.</p>

<p>"Let's see if this one is open," proposed Alice.
"They may be hospitable enough to have left
the door unlocked."</p>

<p>As she spoke she tried the latch. Somewhat
to her surprise the door did open, and then to
the astonishment of both girls they found themselves
in an unoccupied cabin.</p>

<p>"Oh dear!" cried Ruth. "What a disappointment!"</p>

<p>"Isn't it?" agreed Alice. "Well, we can try
the other."</p>

<p>They stood for a moment in the main room of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
the small cabin, and looked about. There was
nothing in it save a few boxes.</p>

<p>"We could make a fire&mdash;I have matches, and
we could break up the boxes on the hearth," said
Alice. "Shall we?"</p>

<p>"No, let's go to the other cabin. I'm sure
someone will be there," suggested her sister.</p>

<p>"Come on!"</p>

<p>They stepped to the door, but at that instant
the snow began again, harder than before.</p>

<p>"No use!" cried Alice. "We're doomed to
stay here, I guess."</p>

<p>"Well, it's a shelter, at any rate," sighed
Ruth. She was not frightened now.</p>

<p>"And there's another good thing," went on
Alice. "These cabins are a definite place. If
a searching party starts out for us Mr. Macksey
will be sure to think about these, and look here
for us. I think we are all right now."</p>

<p>"We're better off, at any rate," observed Ruth.
"I believe we might make a fire, Alice."</p>

<p>"That's what I say."</p>

<p>They had taken off their snowshoes, and
now, by stamping and kicking at the boxes, they
managed to break them up into kindling wood.
Soon a little blaze was crackling on the hearth.
The warmth was grateful to the chilled girls.</p>

<p>They stood before it toasting their cold hands,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
and then, when Ruth went to the window to
look out, she called:</p>

<p>"It's stopped snowing again. Don't you think
we'd better run to the other cabin while we have
the chance?"</p>

<p>"I suppose it would be wise," agreed Alice.
"We really ought to start for Elk Lodge, and
we could if we had a guide. Come on."</p>

<p>Together they started for the larger cabin,
but when half way to it they saw three men coming
out. The men had guns over their shoulders,
and they headed down the trail, away from the
girls.</p>

<p>Not before, however, the two sisters had a good
view of the features of the trio. And instantly
the same thought came to both.</p>

<p>"Did you see who one of those men was?"
gasped Ruth.</p>

<p>"Yes, it is he! And those are the same two
men who were with him before," answered Alice.</p>

<p>"Dan Merley&mdash;the man who is going to sue
daddy for that five hundred dollars!" went on
Ruth, clasping her hands.</p>

<p>"And with him are the two men who were
present when the street car accident happened
in New York&mdash;Fripp and Jagle. They are the
hunters who have been annoying Mr. Macksey."</p>

<p>"Oh, what shall we do?" asked Ruth. "We<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
can't appeal to them for help, not after the way
Merley behaved to us."</p>

<p>"Of course not! Oh, isn't it provoking? Just
as we see help we can't avail ourselves of it. The
men are getting farther and farther away," Alice
went on. "If we are going to appeal to them
we must be quick about it."</p>

<p>"Don't call to them!" exclaimed Ruth. "It
might be dangerous. They haven't noticed us&mdash;let
them go. But Alice, did you see how Merley
seems to have recovered from his accident? He
walks as well as the others."</p>

<p>"Yes, so he does. I'm glad they didn't see
us. But I have a plan. There may be other
persons in the cabin. When the three men are
out of sight, and they will be in the woods in
a little while, we can go and ask help of whoever
is left in the cabin."</p>

<p>"Yes," agreed Ruth, and they waited, going
back to the small cabin. "I remember now,"
Ruth added after a pause, "that man who was in
the bushes the time of the coasting race was
Fripp. I knew I had seen him somewhere before,
but I could not recall him then."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>

<h3>THE PLAN OF RUSS</h3>


<p>The three men, with their guns on their
shoulders, passed out of sight into a clump of
woodland.</p>

<p>"Now's our chance," said Alice. "We'll slip
over to the other cabin, and see if we can get
help. These men are evidently up here on a
hunting trip, and they may have a man cook, or
some sort of help in the cabin. Whoever it is
can't refuse to at least set us on the right road.
We don't need to mention that Mr. Merley is
going to sue our father."</p>

<p>"I should say not," agreed Ruth. "Oh, that
horrid man! I never want to see him again.
But isn't it queer how soon he recovered from
his injury?"</p>

<p>"Rather odd. We must tell daddy about it
when we get back."</p>

<p>"If we ever do," sighed the older girl.</p>

<p>"If we ever do?" repeated Alice. "Why of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
course we'll get back. I don't believe it is going
to storm any more."</p>

<p>"I hope not."</p>

<p>On their snowshoes the moving picture girls
made their way to the second cabin. But again
disappointment awaited them, for there was no
answer to their repeated knocks.</p>

<p>"No one at home," spoke Alice. "Shall we
try to go in?"</p>

<p>"It would do no good," Ruth decided. "If
it is shelter we want we can get it at the other
cabin. And as there is no one at home here
we can't ask our way. Besides, those men might
come back unexpectedly, and I wouldn't have
Merley and his two companions find us in their
cabin for anything!"</p>

<p>"Neither would I. That Merley would be
mean enough," Alice declared, "to charge us
rent, and add that to the five hundred dollars
he is going to make daddy pay."</p>

<p>"Oh, Alice! What queer ideas you have.
But, dear, we mustn't linger here. I wonder if
it would do to follow those men?"</p>

<p>"Follow them? What in the world for?"</p>

<p>"Why they seem to have taken some sort of
a trail, and it may lead out to a road that will
take us to Elk Lodge."</p>

<p>"It isn't very likely," Alice declared. "I'm<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
sure I know the general direction in which Elk
Lodge lies, and it's just opposite from where
those men went. I think, now, that the storm has
stopped, that we can get back on the path."</p>

<p>"Then, for goodness sakes, let's try!" proposed
Ruth. "It seems to be getting darker.
Oh, if they would only come for us!"</p>

<p>"Let us try to help ourselves first," counseled
Alice.</p>

<p>The girls retraced their steps, going back toward
the smaller cabin. They stopped in for a
moment to see that the blaze they had kindled on
the hearth was out, for they did not want a
chance spark to set fire to the place. But the
embers were cold and dead, for the wood had
been light, and there was not much of it.</p>

<p>Then gliding over the crust on their snowshoes,
Ruth and Alice got back to the sheltering
rock.</p>

<p>"Let me look about a bit," Alice requested.
"I think I can pick up the trail again. If I
could only get back to the point where we got off
from I would be all right."</p>

<p>She walked about a little and then, passing
through a small clump of trees, while Ruth remained
at the rock, Alice suddenly gave a joyful
cry.</p>

<p>"I've found it!" she called. "Come on,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
Ruth. It's all right. I'm on the proper path
now."</p>

<p>Ruth hurried to join her sister, and confirmed
the good news. They recognized the path by
which they had come, and soon they were traveling
along it, certain, now, that they were headed
for Elk Lodge.</p>

<p>And their adventures seemed to be over for
that day at least, for, on covering about three-quarters
of a mile they were delighted to see,
hurrying toward them, Russ and Paul.</p>

<p>"There are the boys!" cried Alice.</p>

<p>"And I was never more glad to see anyone in
all my life!" exclaimed Ruth.</p>

<p>"We're not lost now, and don't really need
them," said Alice.</p>

<p>"Well, don't tell them that&mdash;especially after
they have been so good as to come for us," advised
Ruth.</p>

<p>"Silly! Of course I won't!"</p>

<p>"Well, you two seem to have the oddest faculty
for getting into trouble!" cried Russ as he
and Paul reached the girls. "The whole Lodge
is worried to death about you, and we're all out
searching for you."</p>

<p>"Oh, it's too bad we gave so much trouble,"
responded Ruth, contritely. "But we couldn't
help it. We were lost in the storm."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span></p>

<p>"We thought that likely," Paul said. "Your
father is quite worried."</p>

<p>"Is he out searching, too?" Alice asked.</p>

<p>"No, his throat troubles him," the young actor
replied. "But every other man at the Lodge is.
Mr. Macksey told us to come this way, and if we
didn't locate you we were to meet him at some
place where there are two cabins."</p>

<p>"We just came from there," Ruth said, "and
we had the oddest adventure. I'll tell you about
it when we get back. We tried to get a guide to
show us the path, but as it happened we didn't
need one. Oh, I believe it's snowing again!"</p>

<p>Some white flakes were sifting down.</p>

<p>"It's only a little flurry," decided Paul. "And
it won't matter, for the path back is very plain
now. But what happened?"</p>

<p>The girls told him, and when he heard that
Merley was in the neighborhood, and apparently
uninjured, Russ said:</p>

<p>"I always thought that fellow was a faker.
I'd like to know what his game was."</p>

<p>"Do you think it is a game?" asked Alice.</p>

<p>"Yes, and I think it's more of a game than
the game they are after up here. I think they're
hatching some plot."</p>

<p>They arrived at Elk Lodge a little later, and
leaving the girls with their father, Russ and Paul<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
went after the other searchers, to tell them that
the lost ones were found.</p>

<p>"You must not go away alone again," cautioned
Mr. DeVere to his daughters, when all the
searchers had returned, and there was a joyful
reunion in the big living room.</p>

<p>"We won't!" promised Alice. "I was really
a bit frightened this time."</p>

<p>"A <i>bit</i> frightened!" cried Ruth. "I was awfully
scared! I could see us both frozen stiff
under the snow, and the dogs nosing us out as
they do travelers in the Alps."</p>

<p>"I'm glad that didn't happen," laughed Russ.
"For I suppose if it had Mr. Pertell would have
insisted on having a moving picture of it, and I
would have been too prostrated with grief to be
able to work the camera."</p>

<p>"Well, we're all right now," declared Alice.
"And such an appetite as I have!"</p>

<p>"Did you tell your father about Dan Merley?"
asked Russ.</p>

<p>"Oh, no!" exclaimed Ruth. "Listen Daddy,
whom do you think we saw?"</p>

<p>"Not Dan Merley up here?" cried the actor.</p>

<p>"Yes, he was with two other men&mdash;those who
were with him when he was hurt by the street
car."</p>

<p>"Dan Merley up here?" mused Mr. DeVere.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
"I wonder what he can want? Can he be going
to make trouble for me?"</p>

<p>"We won't let him, Daddy!" cried Alice. "If
he walks over here to ask for that five hundred
dollars again, I'll&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You say he was walking around?" cried Mr.
DeVere.</p>

<p>"Yes, on snowshoes," answered Ruth. "He
was walking as well as anyone."</p>

<p>"And he was supposed to be seriously hurt!"
murmured the actor. "Where is that paper?"
and he looked about him.</p>

<p>"What paper?" asked Ruth.</p>

<p>"That New York paper I was just reading.
There is something in it I want to show you. I
begin to see through this."</p>

<p>The journal was found, and Mr. DeVere
glanced through it rapidly, looking for some item.
Russ and the two girls watched him curiously.</p>

<p>"Here it is!" cried the actor. "It is headed
'Brings Damage Suit for Ten Thousand Dollars.'
Listen, I'll just give you the main facts. It says
Dan Merley had started an action in one of the
courts demanding ten thousand dollars' damages
for being hurt by a street car. Merley claims he
will never be able to walk again, because his back
is permanently hurt. And yet you saw him walking?"
he appealed to the two girls.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>

<p>"We certainly saw him," declared Ruth.</p>

<p>"Then that is a bogus damage suit. He isn't
hurt at all. The court should know of this, and
so should the street car company. I shall write
to them!"</p>

<p>"Wait!" cried Russ. "I have a better idea."</p>

<p>"What is it?" asked Mr. DeVere.</p>

<p>"I'll get some moving pictures of him," went
on the young operator. "I'll take a film, showing
him tramping around, hunting, and when that
is shown to the street car company's lawyer I
guess that will put an end to Mr. Merley's suit.
I'll film the faker!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>

<h3>THE PROOF ON THE FILM</h3>


<p>Enthusiastic over his new idea, Russ gazed
triumphantly at Mr. DeVere and the two girls.
They did not seem to comprehend.</p>

<p>"What&mdash;what was that you said?" asked Mr.
DeVere.</p>

<p>"I said I was going to make a moving picture
of that faker," repeated Russ. "Excuse that
word, but it's the only one that fits."</p>

<p>"Yes, he really is a faker and cheat," agreed
the actor. "And, Russ, your idea is most excellent.
It will be the best kind of evidence against
the scoundrel, and evidence that can not be controverted."</p>

<p>"That's my idea," went on the young operator.
"Some of these accident fakers are so clever that
they fool the doctors."</p>

<p>"Do they really make a business of it?" asked
Ruth.</p>

<p>"Indeed they do," Russ answered. "Some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>times
a gang of men, who don't like to work for
a living, plan to have a series of accidents. They
decide on who shall be 'hurt,' and where. Then
they get their witnesses, who will testify to anything
as long as they get paid for it. They hire
rascally lawyers, too. Sometimes they have fake
accidents happen to their wagons or automobiles
instead of themselves. And more than once conductors
or motormen of cars have been in with the
rascals."</p>

<p>"It doesn't seem possible!" protested Alice.</p>

<p>"It is though," her father assured her. "I
read in a newspaper the other day how two fakers
were found out and arrested. But they had secured
a large sum in damages, so I presume they
figured that it paid them. I knew Dan Merley
was an unprincipled man, but I did not believe he
was an accident swindler. But you can stop him,
Russ."</p>

<p>"I don't see how you are going to do it," remarked
Alice. "I mean, I don't see that Dan
Merley will let you take a moving picture of him,
to show to the court, proving that he is a
swindler."</p>

<p>"I don't suppose he would&mdash;if he knew it,"
laughed Russ. "But I don't propose to let him
see me filming him. I've got to do it on the sly,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
and it isn't going to be very easy. But I think I
can manage it."</p>

<p>"I wish we could help you," said Ruth.</p>

<p>"Perhaps you can," the young moving picture
operator answered. "I'll have to make some
plans. But we've got a big day ahead of us to-morrow,
and I can't do it then. I'll have to wait."</p>

<p>"Do you think I had better write to the court,
and to the lawyers of the street car company?"
asked Mr. DeVere. "Your plan might fail,
Russ."</p>

<p>"Well, of course it might, that's a fact. But
there is time enough. I'd like to try my way
first, though, for it would be conclusive proof.
If you sent word to the lawyers, and they sent a
witness up here to get his evidence by eyesight,
Merley might hear of it in some way and fool
them. He might pretend to be lame again, if he
knew he was being watched.</p>

<p>"Then, too, he could bring his own witnesses
to prove that he was lame and unable to walk.
It would be a case of which witnesses the court
and jury would believe.</p>

<p>"But if I get the proof on the film&mdash;you can't
go back of that. Just imagine, working a moving
picture machine in one of the courts!" and he
laughed at the idea.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span></p>

<p>"Perhaps you won't have to go to that end,"
suggested Ruth.</p>

<p>"No, we may be able to give Merley a hint that
he had better not keep on with the suit," Mr.
DeVere said. "Well, Russ, I wish you luck."</p>

<p>A little later all the members of the company
had heard of Russ's plan and Mr. Pertell said
that as soon as the big drama was finished Russ
could have as much time as he wanted to try and
get a moving picture film of Merley.</p>

<p>"I'll have to go over to that cabin, and sort of
size up the situation," Russ decided. "I want to
get the lay of the land, and pick out the best spot
to plant my camera. I suppose it will have to be
behind a clump of bushes."</p>

<p>"Oh, no! I know the very place for you!"
cried Ruth.</p>

<p>"Where?" he asked.</p>

<p>"In the second, or small cabin. You can hide
yourself there and focus your camera through the
window. Then you can film him without him
seeing you."</p>

<p>"Good!" cried Russ. "That will be the very
thing!"</p>

<p>As Russ had said, the next day was a very busy
one for him, and all the members of the company.
Several important scenes in the big drama were
made. A few of them were interiors, in the barn<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
or in the living room of Elk Lodge, and for this
the players were thankful, for the weather had
turned cold, and it was disagreeable outdoors.</p>

<p>Still, some snow scenes were needed, and the
work had to go on. Russ had one of his hands
slightly frost-bitten using it without a glove to
make some adjustments to his camera, and the tips
of Mr. Sneed's ears were nipped with the cold.</p>

<p>This happened when the actor was doing a little
bit which called for him to shovel a supposedly
lost and frozen person out of a snow bank. Of
course a "dummy" was put under the snow, and
the real person, (in this case Mr. Bunn,) acted up
to the time of the snow burial. Then a clever substitution
was made and the film was exposed again.
This is often done to get trick pictures.</p>

<p>Mr. Sneed was shoveling away at the snow
bank. His ears had been very cold, but suddenly
seemed to have lost all feeling. He was rather
surprised, then, when the act was over, to have Mr.
Switzer rush up to him with a handful of snow
and hold some over each ear.</p>

<p>"Here! Quit that! What do you mean?"
cried the grouchy actor.</p>

<p>"I got to do it alretty yet!" exclaimed the German.</p>

<p>"Quit it! Stop it!"</p>

<p>"No, I stops not until I haf der cold drawed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
out of your ears. They are frosted, mine dear
chap, und dis is der only vay to make dem proper.
I know, I have been in der Far North."</p>

<p>"That's right&mdash;it's the best way. Hold snow
on your frosted ears or nose, whatever it happens
to be," declared Mr. Pertell. "You can thank Mr.
Switzer for saving you a lot of trouble, Mr.
Sneed."</p>

<p>"Humph! It's a funny thing to be thankful
for&mdash;because someone washes your face with
snow," declared the grouchy actor.</p>

<p>It was two days later before Russ had time to
carry out his plan of "filming the faker," as he
referred to it. Then he and Paul, with Ruth and
Alice, went to the two cabins. Russ took along a
special moving picture camera made for fast work,
and one with a <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'lense'">lens</ins> that admitted of a long
focus.</p>

<p>"For Merley may not come very near the small
cabin," the young moving picture operator said.
"I may have to get him a long way off. But I
don't want to miss him."</p>

<p>When the four were in the vicinity of the place
they proceeded cautiously, for they did not want
to expose themselves. From a screen of bushes
Russ took an observation, and announced that the
coast was clear.</p>

<p>"We'll slip into the cabin, and stay there as long<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
as we can," Russ said, and they ran across an
open space. As far as they could tell they were
not observed.</p>

<p>Two hours passed, and Russ was beginning to
be afraid his plan would be a failure, for that day
at least.</p>

<p>"But I'll come back again to-morrow, and the
next day&mdash;until I film that faker!" he exclaimed.
"I'm going to expose him!"</p>

<p>"Look!" exclaimed Paul, who was standing
near a window. "There are two men over near
that other cabin. Is one of them Merley?"</p>

<p>Russ and Alice reached the window at the same
time.</p>

<p>"There he is!" Alice cried.</p>

<p>"And walking as well as any man," Russ exclaimed.
"Here's where I get him!"</p>

<p>The moving picture camera was brought to the
casement, and a moment later Russ began clicking
away at it. He had it focused on Merley who,
with Fripp, was walking about the other cabin.
Merley walked without the suspicion of a limp,
and a little later he took a shovel, and began clearing
snow away from some of the walks.</p>

<p>"Good!" cried Russ. "Better and better! If
he can do such strenuous work as that he isn't
hurt. This cooks your goose, Dan Merley!"</p>

<p>He continued to grind away, getting the proof<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
of the fellow's criminality on the sensitive film.</p>

<p>"Oh, they're coming over this way!" exclaimed
Ruth. "What shall we do?"</p>

<p>"Nothing," declared Russ, calmly. "The
nearer he comes the better pictures I can get.
Don't be afraid. Paul and I are here."</p>

<p>Merley had indeed started toward the smaller
cabin. He was walking rapidly and well, and Russ
got some excellent pictures. Then Fripp, who remained
at the larger cabin, called to his companion,
who turned back for some reason.</p>

<p>"Good!" cried Russ. "I've got him going and
coming! Oh, this will be great!"</p>

<p>He continued to grind away at the film, and
soon had sufficient pictures.</p>

<p>"But how are we going to get away without
them seeing us?" asked Alice.</p>

<p>"We can wait until dark," Russ said.</p>

<p>But there was no need. A little later the two
men went into the large cabin, and presently came
out with their guns. There was no sign of Jagle.
But Merley and Fripp started for the woods, and
as soon as they were out of sight the four emerged
from the small cabin, Russ carrying his camera
that now contained the proof on the film. They
hurried back to Elk Lodge.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXV</h2>

<h3>THE MOVING PICTURE</h3>


<p>The last drama of the backwoods had been
filmed. The unexposed reels were sent in to New
York, together with the one made of Dan Merley,
showing a supposedly injured man walking vigorously
about.</p>

<p>"And now good-bye to Elk Lodge," sighed
Alice, when they were packing up to go back to
New York. "I'm sorry to leave it."</p>

<p>"So am I!" added Ruth. "We have had some
lovely times here."</p>

<p>"And strenuous ones, too," spoke Alice.</p>

<p>"Oh, but won't I be glad to see dear old
Broadway again!" cried Miss Pennington, affectedly.</p>

<p>"And won't I!" sighed Miss Dixon. "I want
to see the sights."</p>

<p>"As if there weren't finer ones here than any
in New York!" murmured Alice.</p>

<p>"Everyone to their notion, my dear," remarked
Miss Pennington, in a pert manner.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span></p>

<p>The last days at Elk Lodge were ones of delight.
For the weather was good, and there was
plenty of snow, which made fine coasting. There
was also skating, with a number of straw rides.</p>

<p>The members of the picture company gave
themselves up to pleasure, and Russ put away his
cameras and joined in the fun with the others.</p>

<p>"I don't care what happens now!" he cried.
"I don't have to film it."</p>

<p>Paul and Russ, with the two girls, paid another
visit to the vicinity of the two cabins. There was
a deserted look about the larger one, and a cautious
examination revealed the fact that the occupants
had gone.</p>

<p>"I suppose he has returned to New York to
prosecute his suit against the street car company,"
said Ruth.</p>

<p>"And also his one against daddy," added Alice.</p>

<p>Three days later the moving picture company
returned to New York.</p>

<p>"And what are the next plans&mdash;I mean what
sort of pictures are you going to make next?"
asked Mr. DeVere of Mr. Pertell.</p>

<p>"I haven't quite made up my mind. I'll let you
all know a little later," the manager answered.</p>

<p>"I hope it isn't any more snow and ice," remarked
Mr. Bunn.</p>

<p>Mr. Pertell only smiled.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. DeVere and his daughters went to their
apartment, Russ accompanying them. His mother
and brother were glad, not only to see the young
operator but the DeVere family as well.</p>

<p>The next day Mr. DeVere received a call from
a lawyer who said he represented Dan Merley.</p>

<p>"I have come to see if you are ready to pay
that five hundred dollars before we go to court,
Mr. DeVere," the lawyer said, stiffly.</p>

<p>"I haven't got it," answered the actor.</p>

<p>"Very well then, we shall sue and you will
have to pay heavy costs and fees, in addition to
the principal."</p>

<p>Mr. DeVere was very much worried, and spoke
of the matter to Russ. The young operator
laughed.</p>

<p>"Dan Merley will never collect that money,"
he said.</p>

<p>"What makes you think so?"</p>

<p>"I don't think&mdash;I know. Give me that lawyer's
address, and then don't do anything until you hear
from me."</p>

<p>It was two days later that Russ said to the
actor:</p>

<p>"Can you make it convenient to be at our film
studio this evening?"</p>

<p>"I think so&mdash;why?" asked Mr. DeVere.</p>

<p>"You'll see when you get there."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<p>"May we come?" asked Ruth.</p>

<p>"Surely," Russ answered. "I think you'll enjoy
it, too!"</p>

<p>Rather mystified, but somehow suspecting what
was afoot, the two girls accompanied their father
to the studio at the appointed hour. Russ met
them and took them into the room where the films
were first shown after being prepared for the projector.
It was a sort of testing room.</p>

<p>"I think you have met this gentleman before,"
said Russ, as he nodded at one sitting in a corner.
It was Dan Merley's lawyer.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I guess Mr. DeVere knows me," returned
the latter. "I understand you have come
here for a settlement," he went on.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Russ, smiling.</p>

<p>"A&mdash;a settlement!" murmured Mr. DeVere.
"I&mdash;I am not prepared to settle. I have not the
money!"</p>

<p>"You don't need the money," declared Russ.
"You have brought Mr. DeVere's promissory
note with you; have you not?" he asked the
lawyer.</p>

<p>"I brought it, at your request," was the answer.
"But I tell you, here and now, that it will not be
surrendered until the five hundred dollars is paid."</p>

<p>"Oh yes," said Russ gently, "I think it will.
Look! Ready!"</p>

<p>As he spoke the room was suddenly darkened,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
and then, on the big white screen, there sprang
into prominence life-size moving pictures of Dan
Merley, showing him walking about the backwoods
cabin, and shoveling snow. The likeness
was perfect.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;er&mdash;I&mdash;what does this mean?" stammered
the lawyer, springing to his feet.</p>

<p>"It means that Dan Merley is a faker!" cried
Russ, as the lights were turned up again, and Mr.
Pertell came up from the booth where he had been
working the moving picture machine.</p>

<p>"It means that he is a faker when he says he
was injured by the street car," cried Russ, "and
we're going to show these pictures in court if he
persists in the suit. And it means he's a faker
when he says Mr. DeVere owes him five hundred
dollars. It means he's a faker from beginning
to end! We've got the proof on the film!" and
his voice rang out.</p>

<p>"Oh, Russ!" cried Ruth, and she clasped his
hand in delight.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;er&mdash;I&mdash;" stammered Mr. DeVere as he
sank into a chair.</p>

<p>"Daddy, you won't have to pay!" exclaimed
Alice, joyfully.</p>

<p>"How about that, Mr. Black?" asked Russ of
the lawyer. "Do you think your client will go
on with the street car suit?"</p>

<p>"Well, my dear young man, in view of what<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
you have shown me, I&mdash;er&mdash;I think not. In fact
I know not." The lawyer was beaten and he
realized it.</p>

<p>"And about Mr. DeVere's note?" asked Russ.</p>

<p>The lawyer took out his pocketbook.</p>

<p>"Here is the note," he muttered. "You
have beaten us. I presume if we drop both
suits that you will not show these pictures in
court?"</p>

<p>"It won't be necessary," said Russ. "If the
suits are withdrawn the pictures will not be
shown. But they will be kept&mdash;for future reference,"
he added significantly.</p>

<p>"I understand," <ins title="Transcriber's Note: this word unclear in the original">spoke</ins> the lawyer. "You are
a very clever young man."</p>

<p>"Oh, the young ladies helped me," laughed
Russ.</p>

<p>"Good-night," said the lawyer, bowing himself
out.</p>

<p>"There you are, Mr. DeVere!" cried Russ, as
they were on their way from the studio. "You'd
better destroy that note. It's the only evidence
Merley had, and now you have it back. Tear it
up&mdash;burn it!"</p>

<p>"I will indeed! I never can thank you enough
for securing it for me. Those moving pictures
were a clever idea."</p>

<p>The next day formal notice was sent to Mr.
DeVere that the suit against him had been with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>drawn,
and Merley had to pay all advance court
charges. The actor would not again be made to
pay the five hundred dollars. The suit against the
street car company was also taken out of court.
And Dan Merley and his confederates disappeared
for a time. It seems that Merley went to the
woods to hunt as a sort of relief from having to
pose all the while in New York as an injured man.
He felt at home up in that locality, having been
there many times before.</p>

<p>"Well," said Mr. Pertell to Mr. DeVere and
the girls one day, when he had called to see them,
"I suppose you are ready for more camera work
by this time?"</p>

<p>"What now?" asked Ruth. "Can't you give
us something different from what we have been
having?"</p>

<p>"Indeed I can," was his answer. "How
would you like to go to Florida?"</p>

<p>"Florida!" the girls cried together. "Oh, how
lovely."</p>

<p>"That's answer enough," said the manager.
"We leave in a week!"</p>

<p>"I wonder what will happen down there?"
asked Alice.</p>

<p>And my readers may learn by perusing the next
volume of this series, to be entitled "The Moving
Picture Girls Under the Palms; Or, Lost in the
Wilds of Florida."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span></p>

<p>"It seems too good to be true," spoke Alice that
night, as she and Ruth were talking over what
dresses they would take.</p>

<p>"Doesn't it! Oh, I am just wild to go down
South!"</p>

<p>"So am I. I'd like to know what part we're
going to."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Oh, you know those two girls we met in the
train. They were going somewhere near Lake
Kissimmee. We might meet them."</p>

<p>"We might," answered Ruth sleepily. "Put
out the light, dear, and come to bed. We will
have some busy times, getting ready to go to
Florida."</p>

<p>And thus we will take leave of the moving
picture girls.</p>
